I'm a journalist and programmer. I currently work as a data investigations advisor for the NGO [Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org), where I help campaign teams with data-driven investigations and produce my own stories. My [most recent major story](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/btc-e-vinnik-mayzus/) looks at the collapse of the Bitcoin exchange BTC-e.

I finished a [PhD in contemporary poetry](https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/68758/) at the University of Sussex in 2016 then worked as a data journalist at *The Times* for two and a half years. Before that I worked as a technology journalist and completed my undergraduate and masters degrees at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

At *The Times* I worked on [more than a dozen](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Athetimes.co.uk+louis+goddard) front-page stories, including flagship investigations into [cyber-crime](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-hackers-trade-british-ministers-email-addresses-and-passwords-hqtr7pv9z), [tax havens](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-third-of-british-billionaires-have-moved-to-a-tax-haven-zk6q53rtd) and [government contracting](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gagging-clauses-criticism-of-theresa-may-banned-in-grenfell-safety-deal-7mbdll6cj). I've spoken about my work at conferences in the US, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the UK, generally focussing on my research into [dark net markets](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dark-net-dealers-dragged-into-the-light-kx05bc3jd) and [child abuse forums](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/child-abuse-network-had-10-000-uk-members-d665p2nwk). My main tool is the R programming language.
