Chesterton, Maude Goldring, Annie Matheson, Katharine Tynan, with essays
including one devoted to Rabindranath Tagore by William Scott Palmer,
and an account by Dorothy Wright of “Women and Girls in the Middle
Ages”. A particularly startling issue was that of May 1914, in which
paintings by David Bomberg and A. E. Wadsworth are reproduced (in black
and white) and John Rodker’s essay “The ‘New’ Movement in Art” is
published, dealing with Wyndham Lewis and the art associated with
*Blast*. This is described as Futurist, Vorticism apparently not yet a
word in currency. The anonymous editor adds a note: “We hold no brief
for any style in art, but is seems to us that the movement is
*important*, and therefore worthy of the attention of all thinking
people, although it may appear to some people to be vergingon the
insane.”

Abs: This magazine encouraged, interspersed within cultural and broadly
political and philosophical articles, the publication of Imagist poetry,
the American modernists H. D., William Carlos Williams, T. S. Eliot, and
Marianne Moore, as well as D. H. Lawrence, May Sinclair, Dorothy
Richardson, and James Joyce. Ezra Pound contributed reviews. Richard
Aldington was initially literary editor, H. D. taking over for 1916, and
T. S. Eliot becoming so in 1917, remaining until the end in 1919. His
essay ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent’ was published in the
concluding issue. *The Egoist* was much more of a literary magazine than
its predecessors *The New Freewoman* and *The Freewoman*, outside the
scope of this bibliography. These magazines, although feminist, were
periodicals that were more radical than the conventional suffrage
weeklies of the day, and their broadening of feminist ideas beyond the
question of the vote laid the foundation for the considerable literary
(largely male) content of *The Egoist*. See Lucy Delap, “*The
Freewoman*, Periodical Communities, and the Feminist Reading Public” in
*Princeton University Library Chronicle*, Vol. LXI no. 2 (Winter 2000),

Abs: Ford Madox Hueffer (later known as Ford Madox Ford) is said to have
started the magazine in response to Thomas Hardy’s failure to find a
periodical to publish one of his more adult poems. Editor for little
more than the first year, in that time Hueffer published many of the
best writers of the day, including early work by the then little known
Norman Douglas, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis and D. H. Lawrence. Austin
Harrison edited between 1910 and 1923 and continued what had also been a
strong internationalist element by publishing such writers as Chekhov,
Maeterlinck, Katherine Mansfield, Nabokov, Yone Noguchi, and Turgenev,
as well as Aldous Huxley, Harold Monro, and other new English writers.
Remnant changed the review towards an explicitly Conservative point of
view, without literary fireworks. Jerrold’s editorship from 1931 to 1935
rescued the magazine as a serious reviewing journal of literary
modernism, but, after Wilfrid Hindle’s six month stint, Derek
Walker-Smith reverted to explicitly right-wing politics and the magazine
ended its days largely devoid of literary interest.

Abs: Robert Graves was listed as the Assistant Editor. Both Riding and
Graves contributed poems to this general cultural review. “… we are not
‘literary’ except in that we regard words as the most authoritiative
indexes of value, since they are at once the most specific and the most
sensitive instruments of thought; we have no professional prejudice in
favour of words as an aesthetic medium.” - Laura Riding, from the first
issue’s editorial. Other contributors included Norman Cameron, William
Archer, Sally Graves, Honor Wyatt and others. The last volume published
questions posed by writers, including Graves, Naomi Mitchison and Willa
Muir, concerning the pre-war world crisis, with possible answers by
members of various professions.

anti-Scottish polemic, all largely contributed apparently by its editor.
Walter De La Mare contributes one poem. The first series was edited by
Crosland; the new series, following Crosland’s death in 1925, was edited
by W. Sorley Brown from a Galashiels address and devoted to Crosland’s
life and works. The National Library of Scotland’s catalogue suggests
the new series ran to 1931, but no locations have been found for the

Abs: A magazine which began as a student magazine in a light, humourous
vein, with a more literary character largely emerging only after the
Second World War. The relaunch as simply *Granta* in 1980 seems to have
been followed by capitalisation of the brand by Penguin. Although Granta
had published Cambridge students such as Ted Hughes in the post-war
years especially, under Penguin the Granta imprint became a publisher of
novels and non-fiction as well as a magazine of relatively high
production values focused on prose.

issues, namely no. 10 (Sept. 1, 1917) and no. 11 (Sept 15, 1917), which
were Sassoon’s own copies. No. 10 includes Owen’s first printed poem,
"Song of songs", published anonymously.

Abs: The Imagists’ work emphasised the factual, the visual, the spoken
and a search for new rhythms. Their poetry was supported in Britain in
magazines such as *Coterie* and *The Egoist*, *Poetry and Drama* and its
successor *The Monthly Chapbook*; in America, Harriet Monroe’s *Poetry*
(Chicago) published many of the poems that would go into the first
anthology, and Amy Lowell and H.D. were key to the wider audience
Imagism would soon have*.* Imagism asserted itself through a number of
anthologies which in a way operated as an occasional magazine. *Des
Imagistes* contained work by Richard Aldington, H. D., F. S. Flint,
Skipwith Cannell, Amy Lowell, William Carlos Williams, James Joyce, Ezra
Pound, Ford Madox Hueffer, Allen Upward, and John Cournos. *Some Imagist
Poets* had six contributors: Richard Aldington, H. D., John Gould
Fletcher, F. S. Flint, D. H. Lawrence, and Amy Lowell. The last volume,
*Imagist Anthology* (1930), contains work by Aldington, Cournos, H. D.,
Fletcher, Flint, Madox Ford, Joyce, Lawrence and Williams. The Imagists
formed one of the key movements in English language modernism.

Abs: Describing itself on its sub-title banner as "social, national,
economic, cultural" this was a well-produced physically and
intellectually substantial magazine that tried to continue the forum for
different voices and points of view that *The Irish Statesman* had
attempted. It was edited anonymously. The reference to "The Editors",
was to the named editors of the different sections – Art, Music,
Theatre, Film, and Books – but the overall editor appears to have been
Frank O’Connor alone. Contributors included Brian Coffey, Daniel
Corkery, Denis Devlin, C. Ewart Milne, Sean O’Faolain, Liam O’Flaherty,
Patrick Kavanagh, Maud Gonne MacBride and others. Vol. 1 no. 4 (Sept.
1936) contained a symposium on Spain, and the Spanish Civil War was
often in the magazine’s pages. The correspondence could be weighty, e.g.
Father Victor White and Eric Gill debate the nature of modernity and
industrialisation in the letter pages of 1937, and Gill takes up the
theme in his essay in the last issue, "Is there a Papal social
programme?" The magazine was compelled to close following right-wing
Catholic objections to, for example, its coverage of the Spanish Civil
War.

Abs: The Futurist, noisy title suggests an engagement with modernity,
and *Blast* seems to have influenced it a great deal. There is a
sympathetic article on *Ulysses* by Laurence K. Emery [i.e. A. J.
Leventhal], an article by Thomas McGreevy on “Picasso, Mamie [i.e.
Mainie] Jellett and Dublin criticism”, and a prose poem by John W.
Blaine, but the other poetry seems to look back not forward, e.g. work
by F. R. Higgins and a translation of Brian Merriman with a number of
archaisms. Advertisements for products such as Gibsol, The Supreme Skin
Ointment, and the fact that printers had refused to publish the issue of
*The Dublin Magazine* which was originally to carry Leventhal’s review
of Joyce, suggest that squaring artistic ambition with commercial
requirements and the wider cultural environment in Ireland was not going
to be easy. Only one number was issued.

Abs: A vigorously Nietzschean magazine which deplored the work of
Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Laura Riding, D. H. Lawrence,
and James Joyce. Except for Jack Lindsay’s own poetry, it published very
few poems that are remembered today, though two sonnets by Aldous Huxley
are of curiosity value. Other contributors included Liam O’Flaherty, T.
F. Powys, Rhys Davies and Laurence Powys. The magazine’s financial
failure is said to have caused the demise of the Fanfrolico Press.

Abs: With circulation figures of 10,000 in its first year, rising to
20,000 later on, this was no little magazine. Its early editorial stance
was conservative and hostile to ostentatious experiment, though some of
the poets it published contradicted that stance. Poems under the first
editor included those by Hardy, Rupert Brooke, W. H. Davies, Walter De
La Mare, Robert Frost, W. B. Yeats, Edmund Blunden, John Betjeman,
Graham Greene and D. H. Lawrence. When R. A. Scott-James took over in
1934, he included work by Auden, Spender, C. Day Lewis, Louis MacNeice,
George Barker, Christopher Fry, Jack Lindsay and Edwin Muir (who also
contributed criticism).

no. 23 (Jan 15^th^ 1935) reproduces the text of a postcard Ezra Pound

\

Abs: Open to different strands of modern and modernist poetry, *The
Monthly Chapbook* and its pre-war predecessor *Poetry and Drama*
(1913-14; BL: P.P.5193.bd) were strong supporters of the much reviled
but in fact quietly modern “Georgian” poets and the more obviously
modernist Imagists (see *[The Imagist Anthologies]*). In *The Monthly
Chapbook* there were essays on poetry by Eliot, F. S. Flint, Richard
Aldington and others, and poems by E. E. Cummings, Robert Frost,
Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and many more. In the first issue of
*Poetry and Drama* Monro sets out why he resigned the editorship of *The
Poetry Review*, citing the need for independence from commercial and
private interference. The British Library has the main archive of the
magazine’s publisher, The Poetry Bookshop, within its Department of
Manuscripts (BL: Add MSS 57756-68). This bookshop in central London was
not only a specialist retailer and publisher, it held many readings and
even had accommodation for visiting poets, such as Wilfred Owen, helping
to create a more open reception for new poetry in England.

Abs: Although beginning as a cultural review for liberal and centre left
voices, including Ramsay MacDonald, it was when A. R. Orage became
involved in 1907, with funding from George Bernard Shaw and the
Theosophist financier Lewis Alexander Wallace, that this weekly started
to become one of the most influential magazines of its day. Orage was
co-editor with Jackson for less than a year, and then held sway as sole
editor from January 1908 until September 1922. While he published essays
by Chesterton, Wells, and Bernard Shaw which debated the good and ills
of socialism, Orage’s encouragement of writers of a younger generation
brought excellent critics to his pages and made it a magazine read by
many authors who would write their mature work in the 1920s and 30s.
Arnold Bennett reviewed fiction, but also introduced the work of
little-known continental writers, helping to create the context for the
enthusiastic reception, among writers at least, of Chekhov and
Dostoyevski. T. E. Hulme, Edwin Muir, and Ezra Pound were regular
contributors of comment, and, for instance, the ideas behind Imagism
were described early on in *The New Age.* MacDiarmid contributed and one
of the first Suffragettes to be sent to prison, Teresa Billington-Greig
contributed, too. After the War, Orage began to disseminate the ideas of
C. H. Douglas’s Social Credit ideas for rejuvenating the national
economy, but also became more introspective under the influence of G. I.
Gurdjieff’s mystical teachings. The magazine declined following Orage’s
departure.

Abs: ‘The object of NEW VERSE needs expansion in no complex or tiring
manifesto. Poets in this country and during this period of the victory
of the masses, aristocratic and bourgeois as much as proletarian, which
have captured the instruments of access to the public and use them to
convey their own once timid and silent vulgarity, vulgarising all the
arts, are allowed no longer periodical means of communicating their
poems. […]’ - front page, No. 1. Often associated with ‘the Auden
generation’, but in fact it published more broadly. Contributors
included Grigson, Auden, MacNeice, Bernard Spencer, Kenneth Allott,
Norman Cameron, Kathleen Raine, David Gascoyne, Philip O’Connor, Gavin
Ewart, Naomi Mitchison, Joseph Gordon Macleod, Charles Madge, William
Empson, Allen Tate, George Barker, Dylan Thomas and others. No. 26-27
(Nov. 1937) was a double issue devoted to Auden, with contributions from
Isherwood, MacNeice, Spender, Edwin Muir, Dylan Thomas (eg ‘I sometimes
think of Mr Auden’s poetry as a hygiene…’ ), Ezra Pound (‘I might be
inclined to answer yr note IF I cd. discover why your little lot
neglects to import cumming; W.C.W. and one or two other items of
interest’…) and others. The very last issue has a short and not
altogether favourable piece by Wyndham Lewis on the recently deceased W.
B. Yeats (e.g. “Yeats… comes back to us as the memory of a limp hand.”)

MacDiarmid’ being the pseudonym for C. M. Grieve. This was a general
cultural review, publishing essays, short fiction, reviews and poems,
and attempting to link Scotland to artistic movements in Europe.
MacDiarmid’s own poetry was the most important it published; Edwin Muir
in conversation with the composer F. G. Scott, and Muir on German
poetry, are also of interest.

\

Abs: A university magazine which began with a mix of news about student
clubs with short stories, squibs, poems, and reviews. Many items are
signed just by initials. Although work by John Hewitt had already
appeared, with the Winter 1940-41 issue a more outward-looking remit was
announced, debated over several issues, then the anonymity of the
editorship was suspended and John Gallen and Robert Greacen emerged as
editors with the Autumn 1941 issue (at which point the title reverted to
*The Northman*). Contributors in the early 1940s included rather a lot
of work by the editors themselves, as well as work by Alex Comfort, Roy
McFadden and Nicholas Moore, and is also notable for Henry Treece’s
essay “Some notes on the Apocalyptic Movement”. The magazine had
reverted to a more university-based magazine by the mid-1940s.

\

Abs: The assessment by Hoffman, Allen & Ulrich of the poems published in
the magazine seems right: “serious and competent, but imitative
efforts”. It also published reviews and articles on poetry and, from
1925, on drama. Allied to *Poetry* was The Empire Poetry League, also
known as simply The Poetry League, which had been established by 1922 or
earlier. Its aim was to organise meetings, lectures, and generally to
develop knowledge of current poetry. Membership of what appears to have
been a rival to the Poetry Society meant a free subscription to the
magazine. S. Fowler Wright edited from 1921.

with Dickins as London editor, which ran for four issues from 1956-1960
(BL: P.P.7615.ma), and then, much later, the short-lived *Poetry London
/ Apple* magazine, published in London again, which had two issues,
appearing in 1979 and 1982 (BL: P.901/3258). Ronald Duncan was also
involved editorially. A significant collection of Tambimuttu’s
correspondence concerning *Poetry London* is held by the British

\

Abs: Monro’s brief editorship from 1912-13 was outstanding, with essays
that engaged with modernist poetry and its precursors. This included
articles by Lascelles Abercrombie, Henry Newbolt, John Drinkwater and
Harriet Monroe, editor of *Poetry* (Chicago). There were also
contributions by Richard Aldington, Pound and William Carlos Williams.
The magazine took decades to recover from Monro’s departure. After
Stephen Phillips’s undistinguished three-year editorship, Galloway Kyle
took the helm. Very few poets or poems of note were published by him.
Muriel Spark was briefly editor from 1947 to 1949. Her attempts to bring
better work into the magazine were consolidated and expanded by John
Gawsworth (editor from 1949 to 1952). The 1950s and 60s were perhaps
more conservative and only in 1972, with the appointment of Eric
Mottram, did the magazine begin to engage with the range of British
contemporary poetry. Mottram’s fascination with American modernist
poetry could be said to be a return to Monro’s Anglo-American editorial
policy, too. Under his editorship *Poetry Review* introduced many
British readers to new work from across the Atlantic. Editorial pressure
from the Poetry Society’s conservative funders, The Arts Council of
Great Britain, appears eventually to have led to Mottram’s departure, in
1978, and several years of editorial instability. Peter Forbes’s
editorship in the 80s and 90s will be remembered for the magazine’s
association with “The New Generation” promotion of younger poets.
Forbes’s magazine was quietly eclectic in the poetry it published but
perhaps shy of intellectual engagement with texts, a gap to some extent
filled by the joint editorship of David Herd and Robert Potts begun in
2002. This was characterised by a broader eclecticism, a stronger
engagement with the American and British avant-garde, longer, sometimes
more academic essays and articles, and a partnership with the
Whitechapel Gallery which involved reproducing art in the magazine and
hosting readings at the Gallery. In 2005 the poet Fiona Sampson, with a
background in European poetry and translation, took over the helm.

Maelspine, Kasimir Malevich, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Ben Nicholson, Kurt
Schwitters, Michel Seupohor, Gertrude Stein, Josef Peeters, Mies van der
Rohe, and Herwarth Walden. With such a confluence of largely European
and Russian modernists represented in its pages, this was a highly
unusual magazine to have been published in the British Isles. It is one
of the highlights of the inter-war little magazine in Britain.

Edited by C. M. Grieve, the real name of “Hugh MacDiarmid”, it published
groundbreaking self-penned articles on Scottish literature’s history and

several writers of the “Scottish Renaissance”, including Edwin Muir,
Neil M. Gunn, and William Soutar. Its motto was: “Not traditions -

\

Abs: For a time running concurrently with Grieve’s *The Scottish
Chapbook* this magazine, despite the title, was perhaps more
outward-looking, e.g. publishing an early account (for an

an account of the Society and the magazine.

\

Abs: The Promethean Society was a radical political group which stressed
the need for researched, rational responses to domestic and world
problems. The ideas of H. G. Wells seem to have been an influence. It
was perhaps most controversial for its anti-royalist stance, but had a
much broader programme that included birth control, disarmament, a
liberal attitude towards homosexuality and an end to censorship.
Although mainly containing essays, correspondence, Society reports,
short fiction and reviews, the magazine also published poetry. Literary
contributors included the novelist J. Leslie Mitchell (better known as
Lewis Grassic Gibbon), Auden, Desmond Hawkins, John Galsworthy, Francis
Stuart, Naomi Mitchison, George Barker (including an essay on “Poetry
and Contemporary Inertia”), Hugh Gordon Porteus (e.g. on Ezra Pound) and
Wyndham Lewis (on “The Artist as Crowd”). Vol. 4 no. 24 (Feb. 1933)
contains a supplement entitled “Twentieth Century Verse”, with an essay
on Auden by Porteus, and poems by Auden, Michael Roberts, George Barker,
Richard Goodman, Randall Swingler, and A. L. Morton. The magazine is not
to be confused with the commercially successful *Twentieth Century*,
begun in 1951 as successor to the longstanding *Nineteenth Century*, in
turn begun in 1877.

\

Abs: From the Introduction of the first volume: “In the mad scramble of
anthologies vomited from the stolid presses by trainloads are poems of
every hue except red, every minor tone and every temper except that of
revolt. Purple passion is cheek-to-jowl with plaster sanctity; and the
compacent chirpings of the ain’t-you-glad-you’re-living bards knock
elbows with the pessimistic adumbrations of the Sad Young Men who wallow
in the cynical philosophy of Schopenhauer and chew the bitter cud of
futility over double chocolate sundaes, no more brown than their
thoughts and much sweeter, in thousands of Midwest Kandy Kitchens.”
There was an associated organisation, called Rebel Poets, to which each
volume was a yearbook. Each volume consisted of a polemical introduction
and then broadly leftwing poems of an aesthetically conservative nature.
