Chesterton, Maude Goldring, Annie Matheson, Katharine Tynan, with essays
including one devoted to Rabindranath Tagore by William Scott Palmer,
and an account by Dorothy Wright of “Women and Girls in the Middle
Ages”. A particularly startling issue was that of May 1914, in which
paintings by David Bomberg and A. E. Wadsworth are reproduced (in black
and white) and John Rodker’s essay “The ‘New’ Movement in Art” is
published, dealing with Wyndham Lewis and the art associated with
*Blast*. This is described as Futurist, Vorticism apparently not yet a
word in currency. The anonymous editor adds a note: “We hold no brief
for any style in art, but is seems to us that the movement is
*important*, and therefore worthy of the attention of all thinking
people, although it may appear to some people to be vergingon the
insane.”

Abs: This magazine encouraged, interspersed within cultural and broadly
political and philosophical articles, the publication of Imagist poetry,
the American modernists H. D., William Carlos Williams, T. S. Eliot, and
Marianne Moore, as well as D. H. Lawrence, May Sinclair, Dorothy
Richardson, and James Joyce. Ezra Pound contributed reviews. Richard
Aldington was initially literary editor, H. D. taking over for 1916, and
T. S. Eliot becoming so in 1917, remaining until the end in 1919. His
essay ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent’ was published in the
concluding issue. *The Egoist* was much more of a literary magazine than
its predecessors *The New Freewoman* and *The Freewoman*, outside the
scope of this bibliography. These magazines, although feminist, were
periodicals that were more radical than the conventional suffrage
weeklies of the day, and their broadening of feminist ideas beyond the
question of the vote laid the foundation for the considerable literary
(largely male) content of *The Egoist*. See Lucy Delap, “*The
Freewoman*, Periodical Communities, and the Feminist Reading Public” in
*Princeton University Library Chronicle*, Vol. LXI no. 2 (Winter 2000),

Abs: Ford Madox Hueffer (later known as Ford Madox Ford) is said to have
started the magazine in response to Thomas Hardy’s failure to find a
periodical to publish one of his more adult poems. Editor for little
more than the first year, in that time Hueffer published many of the
best writers of the day, including early work by the then little known
Norman Douglas, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis and D. H. Lawrence. Austin
Harrison edited between 1910 and 1923 and continued what had also been a
strong internationalist element by publishing such writers as Chekhov,
Maeterlinck, Katherine Mansfield, Nabokov, Yone Noguchi, and Turgenev,
as well as Aldous Huxley, Harold Monro, and other new English writers.
Remnant changed the review towards an explicitly Conservative point of
view, without literary fireworks. Jerrold’s editorship from 1931 to 1935
rescued the magazine as a serious reviewing journal of literary
modernism, but, after Wilfrid Hindle’s six month stint, Derek
Walker-Smith reverted to explicitly right-wing politics and the magazine
ended its days largely devoid of literary interest.

Abs: Robert Graves was listed as the Assistant Editor. Both Riding and
Graves contributed poems to this general cultural review. “… we are not
‘literary’ except in that we regard words as the most authoritiative
indexes of value, since they are at once the most specific and the most
sensitive instruments of thought; we have no professional prejudice in
favour of words as an aesthetic medium.” - Laura Riding, from the first
issue’s editorial. Other contributors included Norman Cameron, William
Archer, Sally Graves, Honor Wyatt and others. The last volume published
questions posed by writers, including Graves, Naomi Mitchison and Willa
Muir, concerning the pre-war world crisis, with possible answers by
members of various professions.

anti-Scottish polemic, all largely contributed apparently by its editor.
Walter De La Mare contributes one poem. The first series was edited by
Crosland; the new series, following Crosland’s death in 1925, was edited
by W. Sorley Brown from a Galashiels address and devoted to Crosland’s
life and works. The National Library of Scotland’s catalogue suggests
the new series ran to 1931, but no locations have been found for the

Abs: A magazine which began as a student magazine in a light, humourous
vein, with a more literary character largely emerging only after the
Second World War. The relaunch as simply *Granta* in 1980 seems to have
been followed by capitalisation of the brand by Penguin. Although Granta
had published Cambridge students such as Ted Hughes in the post-war
years especially, under Penguin the Granta imprint became a publisher of
novels and non-fiction as well as a magazine of relatively high
production values focused on prose.

issues, namely no. 10 (Sept. 1, 1917) and no. 11 (Sept 15, 1917), which
were Sassoon’s own copies. No. 10 includes Owen’s first printed poem,
"Song of songs", published anonymously.

Abs: The Imagists’ work emphasised the factual, the visual, the spoken
and a search for new rhythms. Their poetry was supported in Britain in
magazines such as *Coterie* and *The Egoist*, *Poetry and Drama* and its
successor *The Monthly Chapbook*; in America, Harriet Monroe’s *Poetry*
(Chicago) published many of the poems that would go into the first
anthology, and Amy Lowell and H.D. were key to the wider audience
Imagism would soon have*.* Imagism asserted itself through a number of
anthologies which in a way operated as an occasional magazine. *Des
Imagistes* contained work by Richard Aldington, H. D., F. S. Flint,
Skipwith Cannell, Amy Lowell, William Carlos Williams, James Joyce, Ezra
Pound, Ford Madox Hueffer, Allen Upward, and John Cournos. *Some Imagist
Poets* had six contributors: Richard Aldington, H. D., John Gould
Fletcher, F. S. Flint, D. H. Lawrence, and Amy Lowell. The last volume,
*Imagist Anthology* (1930), contains work by Aldington, Cournos, H. D.,
Fletcher, Flint, Madox Ford, Joyce, Lawrence and Williams. The Imagists
formed one of the key movements in English language modernism.

Abs: Describing itself on its sub-title banner as "social, national,
economic, cultural" this was a well-produced physically and
intellectually substantial magazine that tried to continue the forum for
different voices and points of view that *The Irish Statesman* had
attempted. It was edited anonymously. The reference to "The Editors",
was to the named editors of the different sections – Art, Music,
Theatre, Film, and Books – but the overall editor appears to have been
Frank O’Connor alone. Contributors included Brian Coffey, Daniel
Corkery, Denis Devlin, C. Ewart Milne, Sean O’Faolain, Liam O’Flaherty,
Patrick Kavanagh, Maud Gonne MacBride and others. Vol. 1 no. 4 (Sept.
1936) contained a symposium on Spain, and the Spanish Civil War was
often in the magazine’s pages. The correspondence could be weighty, e.g.
Father Victor White and Eric Gill debate the nature of modernity and
industrialisation in the letter pages of 1937, and Gill takes up the
theme in his essay in the last issue, "Is there a Papal social
programme?" The magazine was compelled to close following right-wing
Catholic objections to, for example, its coverage of the Spanish Civil
War.

other topics of concern. Its contributors included George Bernard Shaw,
James Stephens, and Sean O’Faolain, as well as George Russell himself

Abs: The Futurist, noisy title suggests an engagement with modernity,
and *Blast* seems to have influenced it a great deal. There is a
sympathetic article on *Ulysses* by Laurence K. Emery [i.e. A. J.
Leventhal], an article by Thomas McGreevy on “Picasso, Mamie [i.e.
Mainie] Jellett and Dublin criticism”, and a prose poem by John W.
Blaine, but the other poetry seems to look back not forward, e.g. work
by F. R. Higgins and a translation of Brian Merriman with a number of
archaisms. Advertisements for products such as Gibsol, The Supreme Skin
Ointment, and the fact that printers had refused to publish the issue of
*The Dublin Magazine* which was originally to carry Leventhal’s review
of Joyce, suggest that squaring artistic ambition with commercial
requirements and the wider cultural environment in Ireland was not going
to be easy. Only one number was issued.

Abs: A vigorously Nietzschean magazine which deplored the work of
Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Laura Riding, D. H. Lawrence,
and James Joyce. Except for Jack Lindsay’s own poetry, it published very
few poems that are remembered today, though two sonnets by Aldous Huxley
are of curiosity value. Other contributors included Liam O’Flaherty, T.
F. Powys, Rhys Davies and Laurence Powys. The magazine’s financial
failure is said to have caused the demise of the Fanfrolico Press.

Abs: With circulation figures of 10,000 in its first year, rising to
20,000 later on, this was no little magazine. Its early editorial stance
was conservative and hostile to ostentatious experiment, though some of
the poets it published contradicted that stance. Poems under the first
editor included those by Hardy, Rupert Brooke, W. H. Davies, Walter De
La Mare, Robert Frost, W. B. Yeats, Edmund Blunden, John Betjeman,
Graham Greene and D. H. Lawrence. When R. A. Scott-James took over in
1934, he included work by Auden, Spender, C. Day Lewis, Louis MacNeice,
George Barker, Christopher Fry, Jack Lindsay and Edwin Muir (who also
contributed criticism).

Scottish novelist Nan Shepherd. Produced on a Gestetner machine. Issue
no. 23 (Jan 15^th^ 1935) reproduces the text of a postcard Ezra Pound

\

Abs: Open to different strands of modern and modernist poetry, *The
Monthly Chapbook* and its pre-war predecessor *Poetry and Drama*
(1913-14; BL: P.P.5193.bd) were strong supporters of the much reviled
but in fact quietly modern “Georgian” poets and the more obviously
modernist Imagists (see *[The Imagist Anthologies]*). In *The Monthly
Chapbook* there were essays on poetry by Eliot, F. S. Flint, Richard
Aldington and others, and poems by E. E. Cummings, Robert Frost,
Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and many more. In the first issue of
*Poetry and Drama* Monro sets out why he resigned the editorship of *The
Poetry Review*, citing the need for independence from commercial and
private interference. The British Library has the main archive of the
magazine’s publisher, The Poetry Bookshop, within its Department of
Manuscripts (BL: Add MSS 57756-68). This bookshop in central London was
not only a specialist retailer and publisher, it held many readings and
even had accommodation for visiting poets, such as Wilfred Owen, helping
to create a more open reception for new poetry in England.

\

Abs: Although beginning as a cultural review for liberal and centre left
voices, including Ramsay MacDonald, it was when A. R. Orage became
involved in 1907, with funding from George Bernard Shaw and the
Theosophist financier Lewis Alexander Wallace, that this weekly started
to become one of the most influential magazines of its day. Orage was
co-editor with Jackson for less than a year, and then held sway as sole
editor from January 1908 until September 1922. While he published essays
by Chesterton, Wells, and Bernard Shaw which debated the good and ills
of socialism, Orage’s encouragement of writers of a younger generation
brought excellent critics to his pages and made it a magazine read by
many authors who would write their mature work in the 1920s and 30s.
Arnold Bennett reviewed fiction, but also introduced the work of
little-known continental writers, helping to create the context for the
enthusiastic reception, among writers at least, of Chekhov and
Dostoyevski. T. E. Hulme, Edwin Muir, and Ezra Pound were regular
contributors of comment, and, for instance, the ideas behind Imagism
were described early on in *The New Age.* MacDiarmid contributed and one
of the first Suffragettes to be sent to prison, Teresa Billington-Greig
contributed, too. After the War, Orage began to disseminate the ideas of
C. H. Douglas’s Social Credit ideas for rejuvenating the national
economy, but also became more introspective under the influence of G. I.
Gurdjieff’s mystical teachings. The magazine declined following Orage’s
departure.

Abs: ‘The object of NEW VERSE needs expansion in no complex or tiring
manifesto. Poets in this country and during this period of the victory
of the masses, aristocratic and bourgeois as much as proletarian, which
have captured the instruments of access to the public and use them to
convey their own once timid and silent vulgarity, vulgarising all the
arts, are allowed no longer periodical means of communicating their
poems. […]’ - front page, No. 1. Often associated with ‘the Auden
generation’, but in fact it published more broadly. Contributors
included Grigson, Auden, MacNeice, Bernard Spencer, Kenneth Allott,
Norman Cameron, Kathleen Raine, David Gascoyne, Philip O’Connor, Gavin
Ewart, Naomi Mitchison, Joseph Gordon Macleod, Charles Madge, William
Empson, Allen Tate, George Barker, Dylan Thomas and others. No. 26-27
(Nov. 1937) was a double issue devoted to Auden, with contributions from
Isherwood, MacNeice, Spender, Edwin Muir, Dylan Thomas (eg ‘I sometimes
think of Mr Auden’s poetry as a hygiene…’ ), Ezra Pound (‘I might be
inclined to answer yr note IF I cd. discover why your little lot
neglects to import cumming; W.C.W. and one or two other items of
interest’…) and others. The very last issue has a short and not
altogether favourable piece by Wyndham Lewis on the recently deceased W.
B. Yeats (e.g. “Yeats… comes back to us as the memory of a limp hand.”)

MacDiarmid’ being the pseudonym for C. M. Grieve. This was a general
cultural review, publishing essays, short fiction, reviews and poems,
and attempting to link Scotland to artistic movements in Europe.
MacDiarmid’s own poetry was the most important it published; Edwin Muir
in conversation with the composer F. G. Scott, and Muir on German
poetry, are also of interest.

\

Abs: A university magazine which began with a mix of news about student
clubs with short stories, squibs, poems, and reviews. Many items are
signed just by initials. Although work by John Hewitt had already
appeared, with the Winter 1940-41 issue a more outward-looking remit was
announced, debated over several issues, then the anonymity of the
editorship was suspended and John Gallen and Robert Greacen emerged as
editors with the Autumn 1941 issue (at which point the title reverted to
*The Northman*). Contributors in the early 1940s included rather a lot
of work by the editors themselves, as well as work by Alex Comfort, Roy
McFadden and Nicholas Moore, and is also notable for Henry Treece’s
essay “Some notes on the Apocalyptic Movement”. The magazine had
reverted to a more university-based magazine by the mid-1940s.

\

Abs: The assessment by Hoffman, Allen & Ulrich of the poems published in
the magazine seems right: “serious and competent, but imitative
efforts”. It also published reviews and articles on poetry and, from
1925, on drama. Allied to *Poetry* was The Empire Poetry League, also
known as simply The Poetry League, which had been established by 1922 or
earlier. Its aim was to organise meetings, lectures, and generally to
develop knowledge of current poetry. Membership of what appears to have
been a rival to the Poetry Society meant a free subscription to the
magazine. S. Fowler Wright edited from 1921.

/ Apple* magazine, published in London again, which had two issues,
appearing in 1979 and 1982 (BL: P.901/3258). Ronald Duncan was also
involved editorially. A significant collection of Tambimuttu’s
correspondence concerning *Poetry London* is held by the British

\

Abs: Monro’s brief editorship from 1912-13 was outstanding, with essays
that engaged with modernist poetry and its precursors. This included
articles by Lascelles Abercrombie, Henry Newbolt, John Drinkwater and
Harriet Monroe, editor of *Poetry* (Chicago). There were also
contributions by Richard Aldington, Pound and William Carlos Williams.
The magazine took decades to recover from Monro’s departure. After
Stephen Phillips’s undistinguished three-year editorship, Galloway Kyle
took the helm. Very few poets or poems of note were published by him.
Muriel Spark was briefly editor from 1947 to 1949. Her attempts to bring
better work into the magazine were consolidated and expanded by John
Gawsworth (editor from 1949 to 1952). The 1950s and 60s were perhaps
more conservative and only in 1972, with the appointment of Eric
Mottram, did the magazine begin to engage with the range of British
contemporary poetry. Mottram’s fascination with American modernist
poetry could be said to be a return to Monro’s Anglo-American editorial
policy, too. Under his editorship *Poetry Review* introduced many
British readers to new work from across the Atlantic. Editorial pressure
from the Poetry Society’s conservative funders, The Arts Council of
Great Britain, appears eventually to have led to Mottram’s departure, in
1978, and several years of editorial instability. Peter Forbes’s
editorship in the 80s and 90s will be remembered for the magazine’s
association with “The New Generation” promotion of younger poets.
Forbes’s magazine was quietly eclectic in the poetry it published but
perhaps shy of intellectual engagement with texts, a gap to some extent
filled by the joint editorship of David Herd and Robert Potts begun in
2002. This was characterised by a broader eclecticism, a stronger
engagement with the American and British avant-garde, longer, sometimes
more academic essays and articles, and a partnership with the
Whitechapel Gallery which involved reproducing art in the magazine and
hosting readings at the Gallery. In 2005 the poet Fiona Sampson, with a
background in European poetry and translation, took over the helm.

Schwitters, Michel Seupohor, Gertrude Stein, Josef Peeters, Mies van der

and Russian modernists represented in its pages, this was a highly
unusual magazine to have been published in the British Isles. It is one
of the highlights of the inter-war little magazine in Britain.

Chapbook* this magazine, despite the title, was perhaps more
outward-looking, e.g. publishing an early account (for an
English-speaking audience) of Friedrich Hölderlin. This internationalism
complemented the theme in its sister magazine of re-making Scotland.

an account of the Society and the magazine.

\

Abs: The Promethean Society was a radical political group which stressed
the need for researched, rational responses to domestic and world
problems. The ideas of H. G. Wells seem to have been an influence. It
was perhaps most controversial for its anti-royalist stance, but had a
much broader programme that included birth control, disarmament, a
liberal attitude towards homosexuality and an end to censorship.
Although mainly containing essays, correspondence, Society reports,
short fiction and reviews, the magazine also published poetry. Literary
contributors included the novelist J. Leslie Mitchell (better known as
Lewis Grassic Gibbon), Auden, Desmond Hawkins, John Galsworthy, Francis
Stuart, Naomi Mitchison, George Barker (including an essay on “Poetry
and Contemporary Inertia”), Hugh Gordon Porteus (e.g. on Ezra Pound) and
Wyndham Lewis (on “The Artist as Crowd”). Vol. 4 no. 24 (Feb. 1933)
contains a supplement entitled “Twentieth Century Verse”, with an essay
on Auden by Porteus, and poems by Auden, Michael Roberts, George Barker,
Richard Goodman, Randall Swingler, and A. L. Morton. The magazine is not
to be confused with the commercially successful *Twentieth Century*,
begun in 1951 as successor to the longstanding *Nineteenth Century*, in
turn begun in 1877.

\

Abs: From the Introduction of the first volume: “In the mad scramble of
anthologies vomited from the stolid presses by trainloads are poems of
every hue except red, every minor tone and every temper except that of
revolt. Purple passion is cheek-to-jowl with plaster sanctity; and the
compacent chirpings of the ain’t-you-glad-you’re-living bards knock
elbows with the pessimistic adumbrations of the Sad Young Men who wallow
in the cynical philosophy of Schopenhauer and chew the bitter cud of
futility over double chocolate sundaes, no more brown than their
thoughts and much sweeter, in thousands of Midwest Kandy Kitchens.”
There was an associated organisation, called Rebel Poets, to which each
volume was a yearbook. Each volume consisted of a polemical introduction
and then broadly leftwing poems of an aesthetically conservative nature.

**20 Chapbook: the magazine of Scottish achievement** / edited by Alec
Donaldson. Glasgow: Scoop Books, then A. & J. Donaldson, No. 1 (Jan.
1946)-12 [1947].

\

Related Imprint: Scoop Books had a short-lived Modern Scots Poets
series, which published collections by John Kincaid and Edward Boyd
respectively.

\

Abs: By its own admission aimed at a popular market (which,
nevertheless, did not materialise), this included articles on Scottish
culture past, present and future; reviews; Gaelic lessons for beginners;
some short fiction; correspondence and poems. Poets included Edward
Boyd, Robert McLellan, George Campbell Hay, Hamish Henderson, Alexander
Scott, Maurice Lindsay. Contemporary poems were generally published in a
section called “Scottish Heritage” which also showcased poems from
centuries earlier. Prose contributors included Naomi Mitchison, Joseph
MacLeod, Alexander Scott (on contemporary Scottish poetry), Charles
Graves (on the poetry of Marion Angus), and the artist J. D.
Fergus[s]on. Maurice Lindsay's article on the controversy over the use
of 'plastic' or synthetic Scots in poetry started what would dominate
the last few numbers: exchanges between the art critic Frederic Quinton
and Hugh MacDiarmid on the nature of modernity within Scots language
writing. Donaldson signed off with a familiar lament: “… the publisher
was confident that the co-operation CHAPBOOK could expect from the many
thousands of intelligent and progressive people in our country would
both lighten his labour and conserve, as far as possible, the limited
financial resources at his disposal. This confidence has proved to have
been misplaced.”

\

Abs: From the first issue: “DINT is experimental in aim. It is to
provide the poets with some more shouting area and a means of

published poets of the 1940s. In the first issue: Henry Treece, Hardiman

Edwin Allan, John Atkins, Denton Welch, Roy McFadden, Valentin

Roy McFadden, Denton Welch, Edwin Allan), and Lyrics (Morwenna Donnelly
and Iain Fletcher). The second half of the magazine returned control to
the editors and included contributions by Brian Allwood, Henry Treece,
Maurice Lindsay, L. E. Leaper, R. Crombie Saunders, John Atkins, Simon
Watson Taylor, Ross Nichols, Sylvia Read, John Christian, David Matthews

Vanson. Derby: Frederic Vanson No. 1 (May 1949)-5 (Sept. 1950)

Related Imprint: Gemini Press, presumably belonging to Vanson himself,
published his *The Furious Finding. Fifteen* *sonnets* (1950, BL:

among them poetry. […] In one sense GEMINI is a result of those
associations.” Vanson would also publish *The Christian Poet* in 1953.

Abs: Emerged from a pre-war “group of young people [who] met regularly
to share their common interest in poetry, drama and music. Significantly
all were under twenty-five and already felt the need for a changed world
in which the delights of a music, colour and words would form an
integral part of the lives of its people. Came the war. Our group was
dispersed by the forces of this new destruction, but, determined to beat
the cultural "black-out", we kept in touch by a type-written quarterly
passed among our members. *Here and Now* is the best of all that
appeared in that "periodical" in 1940.'”- Introduction in first issue.

was fit enough to resume control of the remaining issue. Poets included
Maurice Lindsay, Emanuel Litvinoff, Henry Treece, Derek Stanford and
Molly Francis. In no. 3 it published the manifesto of the Front Line

poetry was then released in *New Generation*. The successor to *Khaki
and Blue* appears to have been *Civvy Street*, edited by F. T. Tubes,
but it was more of a magazine devoted to giving ex-service personnel
practical help, a political voice, and to helping them keep in touch
with each other (BL: Vol. 1 no. 1 [1947], P.P.4050.clc). From the
evidence of the first issue, it did not publish poetry.

\

Profiled in: Hoffman, Allen & Ulrich; Stanton

\

Abs: A magazine produced in reaction to the New Apocalypse poets, and to
the assumption that poetry is essentially a Celtic form. John Atkins’s
first editorial spells out the policy: “the point of the new saxon is
this: he won’t subscribe to the view that to write good poetry you must
be a celt.” The emphasis is on prose, but each issue does carry some
poetry, eg by Patric Dickinson (verse drama), Stevie Smith, and John
Singer. George Orwell contributes an article on "Poetry and the
Microphone" in no. 3, and no. 4 carried work by the poet Brian Allwood,
killed in action in Italy in 1944.

with no. 8, probably to avoid looking like a new little magazine, since

little known, though it did publish Nicholas Moore, Maurice Lindsay,

**148 Writers of the Midlands** / edited by Stanley Derricourt.
Birmingham: [Stanley Derricourt; then Thomas's Publications], No. 1
[1946]-2 [1948?]

\

Abs: A modest attempt to build a cultural critical mass in the Midlands,
publishing short fiction, articles on Midlands arts (e.g. on theatre and
broadcasting), and a poem per issue (James Kirkup and W. H. Boore
respectively). Although a commercial publisher was used for the second
issue, with letters of support from Derek Stanford and J. B. Pick (the
latter welcoming the magazine, but questioning the idea of “Midland
writing”), the magazine appears to have ceased after that.

YH.1987.a.230

Website: www.ambitmagazine.co.uk

\

Abs: Modelled to some degree on John Middleton Murry’s pre-First World
War magazine *Rhythm* (BL: P.P.5938.de), the look and format of this
magazine was established from the first issue, in part because it used
the typesetting machine the Variotyper which allowed the integration of
visual work. Reproductions of sketches and other black and white
drawings intersperse poetry, short stories and comment from the word go,
and there is an independent tone to the editorial and content,
characterised in the first issue by an attack on John Betjeman’s poetry.
In later years colour plates were also used and the magazine
acknowledged “the [editorial] assistance” of J. G. Ballard and Carol Ann
Duffy among others, both of whom had contributed work to the magazine
early on. There is a sensuous hedonism to the production and editorial
values, and it has been controversial. It famously ran a competition for
work produced under the influence of drugs (illegal or otherwise), and
contributions by Ballard, David Hockney and others have sometimes lent
to calls for its funding to be withdrawn. Its 2003 submission guidelines
list the following types of work that should *not* be sent for
consideration: “indiscriminately centre-justified or italicised poems;
parochial "bed-sitter", life is grim, I've got no money poems;
self-consciously poetic poems; poems aspiring to Keats or Wordsworth;
that man (or woman) done me over poems; sweeping generalisation poems;
why are we here, what is it all about poems; [and] horror / ghost /
fantasy stories.”

Charles Tomlinson, Thom Gunn, Sylvia Plath, R. S. Thomas, Philip Larkin,
and others. A sister journal with shorter articles and reviews, *The
Critical Survey*, was published from 1962, as the "journal of the

Abs: Probably a one-off, this appears to be an unofficial student
magazine from Bristol University. It consists solely of fabricated
testimonials in praise of the magazine, an editorial by Leavings (real
name?), four anonymous parodic poems (Eliot and Arnold are sources), and
an agony column which suggests that Empson's salts will purge your
ambiguities.

Thomas Kinsella, Thom Gunn, Peter Porter, Donald Davie, Roy Fisher, and
others. In an interview conducted by John Kinsella, cited above, Peter
Porter remarks of Peter Redgrove: “He actually founded a magazine here
called *Delta* which operated for quite some time. Its subsequent
editors included not only Hobsbaum but also a man who became a very
famous playwright later, Simon Gray. But they all believed in the
principle that literature was discussable. They believed more or less I
suppose what people believed in Ancient Greece, a sort of peripateia
where you wandered around and discussed things.”

editors, or *the* editor.

**40 Gargoyle** / [edited by Kenneth Nobes and Christopher Logue].
Northolt Park, Middlesex: [Gargoyle], Nov. 1951-Oct. 1952?

\

Abs: A little magazine with a satirical tone. The editors’ manifesto
begins: “Our purpose is truly charitable: the Enlightenment of the
Unenlightened and the Dissemination of Culture to the Poor and the
Needy. As if that was not sufficient, another modest object will be to
provide an outlet for the Creative Writer (hallelujah!) - we are
compelled to include this immortal phrase for without it no little
magazine manifesto would be complete - thus satisfying the flank
scratching borborygmics of Kensington, the bard of Winchelsea, and
sparing geniuses the need to contract consumption before attaining
recognition. Contributions are invited for which we offer fame.” Most
contributions in these slender magazines are in fact pseudonymous poems,
but presumably Nathaniel Bloodwhisker and Cornelius Grogpot etc are the
editors. Patrick Brangwyn and Pauline Roberts have poems signed with
their real names.

as well. After Riddell’s departure in 1954, the editors were Sydney
Goodsir Smith, Tom Scott, J. K. Annand, Albert Mackie, Alan Riddell
again (from 1962-1967), then Robin Fulton (1967-1977), Robert Calder,
William Montgomerie (1977-1982), Trevor Royle and Tessa Ransford. Robin
Fulton’s editorship was especially noteworthy for its numbers given over
to contemporary poetry in Europe.

\

Abs: From no. 1: “The broadsheet tradition is a subversive one, and this
broadsheet exists to subvert you. We wish to reintroduce a healthy anger
at bad art and bad government. Poetry is retreating to provincial
universities, criticism has grown mealy-mouthed, honest bawdy is
censored, and every real political opposition is watched by the police.
We solicit serious comment on any of the above tendencies; and also
satire, cartoons and ballads on contemporary events (which may be
doggerel, but must have bite); as well as creative writing and line
drawings.” Edited anonymously. Contributors included Ithel Colquhoun
(poems, and an article on Austin Osman Spare), Oswell Blakeston, Thomas
Blackburn, Paul Potts, Bernard Kops, Raymond Tong, Antony Borrow (e.g.
an article on Thomas Blackburn), Michael Ivens, Robert Greacen
(translating an anonymous Albanian poem), Ewart Milne, and others. Sold

Related Imprint: The Westminster Press published a poetry collection by
Ivo Jarosy, *The Ascent* (1951), BL: 11657.l.36

Abs: The first issue had a rather poorly-composed cover design credited
to Terence Conran. *Nimbus* was at first a modest magazine, publishing
poetry, fiction and essays, with poetry mainly from the British Isles,
e.g. Ruth Bulman, R. F. C. Hull, Frances Bellerby, John Heath-Stubbs,
George Barker, Vernon Watkins, Patrick Galvin and Vernon Scannell. The
range increased with the June/Aug 1953 issue and the magazine went on to
feature contributors as various as C. J. Jung (R. F. C. Hull being his
translator), Alexander Trocchi, D. J. Enright, James Kirkup, Herbert
Read, Bertolt Brecht, Christopher Logue, Conrad Aiken, Jean Cocteau, W.
S. Graham, Paul Eluard, MacDiarmid, Patrick Kavanagh, Geoffrey Hill, Roy
Campbell, Stevie Smith, Richard Wilbur and, in the final issue, Auden,
George Mackay Brown, Danny Abse and William Empson. Some of its reviews
took exception to the poetry of the Movement. Ivo Jarosy joined Tristam
Hull as co-editor from vol. 2 no. 1 (June/Aug. 1953), from when it was
published by John Trafford but printed at the Westminster Press. From
Vol. 3 no. 2 Jarosy was no longer co-editor; David Wright took his place
from that issue.

Related Imprint: Ore Publications published a poetry series in the 1970s

\

Abs: Poetry, articles on poetry, and reviews, especially reflecting the
editor’s concern with magic, ancient Britain, and Arthurian legend.
Poets in the first few years included Geoffrey Holloway, Olive McAllan,
Peter Redgrove, Robert Nye, J. Phoenice, W. Price Turner, Raymond Tong,
Hugh Creighton Hill, Edward Storey, and others. Ratcliffe espoused a
‘neo-pagan’ approach to life in general, as witnessed by his editorials
and other prose interventions. Later catch-phrases were “The magazine
which remembers the island of Britain and those who first came to it”
and “For Arthur’s Britain”. No. 9 includes “The Poet in the imaginary
prop-loft” by Derek Stanford, an article engaging arguing against Donald
Davie’s allegedly over-sophisticated approach to understanding poetry.
No. 28 was a special issue devoted to the late nineteenth century poet
W. E. Henley. No. 30 is a Brian Louis Pearce special issue. Frederic
Vanson contributed to many of the later issues which also included work
by Penelope Shuttle, Jay Ramsay, James Kirkup, William Oxley, Margaret
Toms, Jenny Johnson, Ian Caws, Raymond Tong, Geoffrey Holloway, Ithell
Coloquhoun, Rupert M. Loydell, Stephen C. Middleton and Kenneth Steven.
The last issue included work by John Greening, Peter Russell, Angela

\

Abs: Made possible by a grant from the Ford Foundation to promote
American culture, this British edition of the American general arts
journal was lavish for a literary publication: elegant understated
typography and design, black and white and colour illustration, and many
of the distinguished U.S. critics and writers of the day contributed,
including William Faulkner, William Carlos Williams, Marianne Moore and
many others. Each was edited by a single editor but Laughlin acted as
managing publisher-editor within the U.S. firm of Intercultural
Publications. Literary rather than little.

essays on topics from the learned to the seriously abstruse.” In

\

Index: UK Little Magazines Project

Profiled in: a note attached to the index produced by the UK Little

\

Abs: A statement carried in each issue: “The name of this magazine comes
indirectly from a work by Kurt Schwitters; ‘A Small Home for Seamen’. I
have been told that it was one Agnes Weston who founded the seamen’s
homes in this country and I hope this magazine will likewise provide
some sort of refuge.” A good-looking, even beautiful, magazine, with an
interest in photography, and typically setting out poems with generous
white-space around them. Contributors included: Thomas Meyer, Ian
Hamilton Finlay, Thomas A. Clark, Stuart Mills, Simon Cutts, Trevor
Winkfield, Andrew Crozier, Gael Turnbull, Richard Long, Robert Lax and
others. No. 14 reprints two letters from the East Midlands Art
Association to Stuart Mills, the first setting out the terms of grant
for any successful application, and the second turning Mills’s
application down on the grounds of its luxurious minimalism: “the
selling price was too low for the lavishness of production but unless
the area of print in each publication was increased the public would not
feel inclined to pay any more.”

Abs: The first issue consisted of poems by the editors, plus Jim
Stewart, and various illustrations. These were printed on different
colours and sizes of paper, and simply placed in a plastic bag. It was
sold at the Edinburgh Festival in the summer of 1973, in association
with a sound and vision ensemble known to Hampson, called Zoom Cortex.
This loose leaf “bag mag” physical presentation, with a couple more
poets added to the original editorial line up, continued only for no. 2,
the next issue adopting a stapled card cover. The intention was
announced in no. 3 (Spring 1975) to concentrate more on “one area of
contemporary creative practice” and to represent the range of poetry
being written in England. Further contributors to this issue, which
seems to take a significant leap towards the more difficult and the
avant-garde, included Paul Brown, Lee Harwood (poems, and an essay on
“Surrealist Poetry Today”), Ulli McCarthy, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall,
Boudewijn Wegerif, Heathcote Williams and others. No. 4, edited solely
Robert Hampson, included work by Allen Fisher (and an interview with
him), Jeremy Hilton, Bernard Kelly (including his compilation of
quotations from American poets about Open Field poetry), Roy Fisher,
Eric Mottram, Ulli McCarthy, Alan Davies, Mike Dobbie, Richard Miller,
Emanuel Ro, and the three editors. No. 5 (Autumn 1976) edited by Ken
Edwards, focused on prose poetry, contributors including David Miller,
Nicki Jackowska, Opal L. Nations, Ian Robinson, Steve Snider and others.
That issue also marked a change from the mimeograph stencil production
to commercial printing, presumably offset litho. No. 6 (Summer 1977),
edited by Hampson, includes further work by earlier contributors as well
as by Rosmarie Waldrop, Tom Leonard, Robert Lax, Sarah Lawson, James
Sherry, Elaine Randell, and Barry MacSweeney. With No. 7 (Spring 1978),
edited by Hampson and Edwards, a more visually and physically elaborate
issue was produced. This, the “Assemblage Issue”, included the
specially-mounted, blind-embossed booklet *Honour can be bought & sold
like…* [by Tony Ward?], E. E. Vonna-Michell’s poem about glass-paper,
which included two inserted sheets of that material, and many works of
poetry, usually with a strong visual emphasis, e.g. by Peter Finch,
Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, Alaric Sumner, Herbert Burke, Paula
Claire, Jeremy Adler, Bob Cobbing, P. C. Fencott, cris cheek, Lawrence
Upton and other poets published in previous issues. Edwards’s
acquaintance and correspondence with the Language poet James Sherry was
one of the Anglo-American meeting points of respective contemporary
avant-gardes.

\

Abs: Set up, in the words of the first issue’s editorial, to
“consolidate the work already done by the Association and give notice of
coming projects – whether literary competitions, conferences, courses,
exhibitions or lectures. It will keep members in touch with each other’s
work and advise on many aspects of school magazine production.” Each
issue included a selection of poetry and prose from school magazines,
and essays and other work by much more established poets, critics, and
other writers, often giving a campaigning and intellectual framework to
the project of empowering students through school magazines.
Contributors included Anselm Hollo, Eric Mottram, Herbert Read, Alan
Sillitoe, Robert Penn Warren, Michael Shayer, Gael Turnbull, J. B.
Priestley, Michael Hamburger, Arnold Wesker, and others. Vol. 1 no. 3
also had a listing of school magazines. The Association had a “Magazine

Related Works: Eddie Linden has been portrayed in a number of
fictionalised accounts and/or novels, including Sebastian Barker, *Who
is Eddie Linden?* (London: Jay Landesman, 1979), BL: Nov.40392), a book
which was made into a play by William Tanner, and as the character Sammy
Giffen in Alan Sharp, *The Wind Shifts* (London: Michael Joseph, 1967),
BL: Nov.10708

\

Abs: Strong on essays and tributes to British poets, especially though
not exclusively those who emerged just before and during the 1940s, e.g.
John Heath-Stubbs, W. S. Graham and George Barker. Another strength has
been the Irish poets it has published, including Paul Durcan, Seamus
Heaney, Michael Longley, Derek Mahon, Medhb McGuckian, Paul Muldoon,
Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Eithne Strong, Matthew Sweeney, and others.
Linden has often used the device of guest editor to take advantage of
particular expertise. There can be a considerable time lag between
issues, e.g. four years between 23/24 (1998) and 25/26 (2002).

Abs: A significant outlet for writers in exile or regarded as
dissidents, especially those exiled from Eastern Europe. Although the
first issue does not mention it, it is probably a continuation of *Pen
in Exile* produced by the same organisation. There were poems, stories
and essays, and often a feature themed by country of origin, e.g.
Estonians, Ukrainian, Bulgarian literature, etc. Texts are in English
and other languages, and not usually parallel text. Contributors
include: Czeslaw Milosz, Aleksis Rannit, George Faludy, Jean
Schlumberger, Marina Tsvetayeva, Boris Pasternak, Vladimir Nabokov, as
well as Vera Brittain (writing in no. 4 about the importance of exiles
to Britain), and others. Elizabeth Jennings contributes a review of a
Lithuanian anthology in no. 6. Stephen Spender and Nicholas Nabokov

arranged by Ken Cox, John Furnival, Dom Sylvester Houédard, and Charles
Verey; the last by E.M. de Melo e Castro and Verey. As well as the
organisers, contributors included Ian Breakwell, Thomas A. Clark, Bob
Cobbing, Simon Cutts, Tom Edmonds, Ian Hamilton Finlay, John Hall, Roy
Hewish, Brian Lane, Liliane Lijn, Andrew Lloyd, Peter Mayer, Cavan
McCarthy, Stuart Mills, Edwin Morgan, Hayden Murphy, Tom Phillips, John
J. Sharkey, Trevor Wells, Abilio-José Santos, António Aragão, Ana
Hatherly, José-Alberto Marques, José Viale Moutinho. There are original
contributions, sometimes in colour, photographs of exhibits, and
background information on the poets. Naturally, given the concrete
poetry focus, there is a strong Brazilian contingent.

strong emphasis on contemporary American poetry as well as avant-garde
British texts. Later, he would be as well known as a classical music and

the interspersal of striking prints of a range of styles made this
magazine visually very attractive. Poets included: John Cotton, Patrick
Bridgwater (two “typograms” or concrete poems), Oliver Bayldon and Leon
Spiro. Artists included Graham himself, John Minton, Margaret McCord,
Anne Palmer, Elizabeth Dowling, Paul Peter Piech, John Farrington and
John Piper. There were articles on John Cotton’s magazine *Priapus* (to
which *Enigma* was a spiritual successor), Robert Graves and Laura
Riding’s Seizin Press, Nicolas de Stael as a book illustrator, printing
*Fishpaste*, Rilke’s influence on English poetry, and other topics.

Related Imprint: Motion Books, which operated from the same address as

Frank Popper, Philip Steadman, Reg Gadney and Stephen Bann.

\

Abs: A magazine interested in literary and other arts theory.
Professionally printed with high design and production values that
matched its impressively intellectual remit. As well as theoretical
articles, the magazine published poems, especially visual and sound
poetry. Contributors included: Roland Barthes on “The Activity of
Structuralism”, Pedro Xisto, William Carlos Williams on Emanuel Romano
(posthumously, but for the first time), Ian Hamilton Finlay, Eugen
Gomringer on “The first years of Concrete Poetry”, Raoul Hausmann on
“Meaning and Technique in Phonic Poetry”, David Chaloner, Simon Cutts
(poems, as well as an essay on “The Aesthetic of Ian Hamilton Finlay”)
and others. Each issue featured extracts from what it considered to be a
“Great Little Magazine”, as well as notes and an index to it. Apart from
*Ray* (London, 1927-28), the featured magazines were almost all
published outside of the British Isles: *Secession, Blues*, *G*,
*Mecano, Ray*, *De Stijl*, *SIC*, *Kulchur* and *LEF*. The latter,
though profiled in issue 10, had its index delayed until the intended
issue 11, an issue which seems never to have appeared. The importance to
contemporary practitioners of visual and sound poetry of placing and
asserting their work within a documented historical context, also
demonstrated in magazines such as *Kroklok*, is perhaps no better
illustrated than in *Form*.

Cambridge: [Fuse], No. 1 (June 1972)-4 (Nov. 1973)

\

Abs: “FUSE came into being as a result of a feeling that confrontation
should evolve in the context of communication. We feel that Cambridge
needs a magazine which presents the work of undergraduates beside that
of graduates and senior members, while at the same time placing
University work in a wider perspective. It is important not to see such
work in terms of divisions of any kind; although FUSE is primarily
concerned with literature, we want to set up a focus for a wide range of
creative thought, and to provide the charge for a response.” – the
editorial in no. 1. Contributors included Ian Crichton Smith, Stephen
Poliakoff (short fiction), R. S. Thomas, Peter Levi, John Harvey,

Note: Issue 3 came with a large poster, depicting President Kennedy,
which was used, somewhat obliquely, to advertise the Unicorn Bookshop,
Brighton. Issue 4 bore the cover title *Purple Ga*, and was indeed
purple.

\

Abs: A hippy, psychedelic atmosphere to this magazine. The first issue
has an eighteen-point declaration by the “Bureau of Surreal Activities”
– eg. “9. There are no Virgin Marys… 10. We are the factors determining
the velocity of angels…13. In Britain there are no demilitarised zones…”
Contents included poems, comic strip art, advice on what to do if
arrested, listings of other little magazines, and collages. Despite
*Gaga* stating leftist aspirations, pictures of near-naked women appear
in ways that seem untroubled by their objectification; a collage
announcing “smash the bourgeoisie” uses photos of what appear to be
several Chinese civilians and one Chinese soldier. Poets included
Lawrence Upton, Libby Houston, Helen Fletcher, Peter Finch, Julian
Elliot, the editor and others.

Abs: Beginning as much as a magazine of counterculture as a literary
magazine, *Global Tapestry* was against the Vietnam War and for general
peaceful revolution, love and veganism, and it published the manifesto
of the Love & Peace Freak Party in the second issue. Work by Kenneth
Patchen was published in its pages, and Patchen seems to have been a key
figure for the magazine in the early years; it was soon published more
poetry, with work from the editors, Jim Burns, Andrew Darlington, David
Tipton, Vivienne Finch, Steve Sneyd, Michael Horovitz, and many others.
After a few years, Dave Cunliffe edited the magazine alone. It was
produced in mimegraph format until 1991, when it closed for nearly ten
years, re-launching with what looks like desk-top camera-ready copy in
2000, with issue no. 22.

\

Abs: Contributors included Pete Brown, Mal Dean and Libby Houston,
described as “now working on a series of ‘goings-on’ (free experiments
in jazz, poetry, drama, etc.) at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill
Gate.” Two of the contributors seem to have been work acquaintances of
Lee Harwood, then employed as a packer, including Mal Dean, and Geoffrey
Hazzard. Byrne and Jones were interested in and wrote science fiction;
another contributor, Paul Pignon, was described as a “poet, jazz
musician, composer, & ex-atomic physicist.” This was clearly a magazine
about cross-over and experimentation; now better-known poets also
appeared in its pages, including Harry Guest, Spike Hawkins, Anselm
Hollo and Penelope Shuttle. A second issue was advertised on the last
page of the first issue, to be guest-edited by Anselm Hollo, but seems
not to have materialised.

\

Profiled in: Tom Clyde, *Irish Literary Magazines: an outline history
and descriptive bibliography* (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2003), BL:
2725.g.3414

\

Abs: Related to *Ego* and *Both Sides Now*, this magazine’s expressed
aim was to “enlight and ignite you […and to establish] a small,
independent press.” It published anti Vietnam War political cartoons,
comic strips, sound and visual poetry, more conventional poems, a song
(with sheet music), an interview with an Irishman sent to a mental
hospital in Epsom after being unable to pay a bill at a well-known venue
in London, an account of someone being imprisoned for nine years for
possession of a very small amount of marijuana, short fiction, an
article on the evolution of rock music, and a brief attack on Irish
Prime Minister Jack Lynch following the British Army killings on “Bloody
Sunday”. Issue two reveals an acknowledged affinity with the London Arts
Lab: Hooley had tried to establish an equivalent centre in Belfast, but
had been thwarted by the police. By issue three it described its
circulation as 2000, and explained that it was part of the Queen’s
University student scene without being formally connected to it.
Overall, there is a gentle sense of humour to this counter-culture
magazine but nevertheless a determination to avoid and challenge
political and religious divisions in Belfast and Northern Ireland.
Judging from the high proportion of pages given over to poems, poetry
was central to it. Contributors included Steve Sneyd, Denis Greig,
George Cairncross, Claire Winston, Robert Johnstone, George Dowden, and
others.

Historical figures’ work was included and presented beautifully (George
Herbert, Kurt Schwitters, Apollinaire) and contemporary work and some
comment by Ian Hamilton Finlay, Anselm Hollo, Henri Chopin, John

Abs: From the last issue: “LITTACK is ceasing because it is undeniable
that it has made its fundamental point – namely, it has asserted – and
re-iterated over a period of time – the constant need for a tensional
base for poetry, a polemical climate for the, often violent, exchange of
ideas about the craft. But, as LITTACK has striven to emphasise, such
‘exchange’ cannot confine itself, any more than poetry can, to a
discussion of technicalities. It is easy, in retrospect, to see the
damage that has been done by the modernist’s obsession with technique –
the direct cause of such present-day absurd notions as ‘the poem’s
proper subject is language itself’. Of course, this is false – a poem’s
proper subject is life, words but forming an artifact for the expression
of the subject. Equally absurd has been the imposed fiction, traceable
to Pound, that all attempted expression be limited or restricted to the
object. […] It was out of such a realization that LITTACK created a
polemical forum to allow discussion and controversy, to permit the
pubication of various manifestos, to offer a philosophy of poetry
(neo-vitalism) and, above all, to make the point that life must be let
into poetry all the time.” Contributors included: Kathleen Raine, Hugo
Manning, Tom Scott, Hugh MacDiarmid, Martin Booth, Stephen Wade, Ian
Hamilton Finlay, and others. Peter Russell acted as Overseas Editor.

Note: There appears to have been no issue no. 1 (advice from Peter
Riley).

\

Abs: The title is taken from the village in Wales whose the railway
station has the longest name of any in Britain, and perhaps the world.
Because of its length, library catalogues sometimes replace the title
with the abbreviation *Llanfair P.G*. Contributors to this generally
one-sheet per issue, largely French language magazine included Claude
Royet-Journoud, Claude Faïn, Joseph Guglielmi, Lars Fredrikson, Roger
Laporte, Rosmarie Waldrop (a poem printed so that it could only be read
faintly through the other side of the page), Edmond Jabès, Anthony
Barnett, Roger Giroux, Jean Daive, Keith Waldrop, Hoy himself and
others. There was a strong visual element to many of the texts, using
drawn lines, handwriting, and the whole whitespace of the page.

\

Abs: Contributors include Allen Ginsberg, Ted Berrigan, Ron Padgett,
Gerard Malanga, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and others. Ginsberg declined
payment for his poem “Ankor Wat” and his money was divided among the
other contributors. There was more of a news element to the second issue
of the magazine, for example the drug experimentalist Timothy Leary’s
arrest was reported, as was the founding of the London Free School, and
there were pieces by Tom Wolfe and Harry Fainlight. *Long Hair* can be
regarded as a precursor of the underground press, outside the scope of
this bibliography, such as *International Times* (BL: Newspaper
Library).

stated in the first editorial, was to produce a magazine *not* printed
by typewritten stencil and duplicator. Instead it was “to introduce
poets to people who matter, because it will present their work in normal
book style.” Contributors included many who remain obscure, but also
(presumably) Penelope Shuttle (writing as P. D. Shuttle), and D.M.
Black.

Digest*-like talking-point articles (“Pity the dumb animal”; “Is an
intelligent machine possible?”; “The evils of black magic”), but with
poems interspersed. An open letter issued after the final number reveals
that the magazine had been printed on a Roneo 250 Duplicator. In trying
to trade up to a Gestetner 300 , a part-exchange deal had gone wrong and
only a Roneo 450 had been delivered. Because of difficulties with the
new Roneo, the editor explains, the magazine has had to close.

**332 Other Times** / edited by Mr. E. (Fiction, Portfolio), Paul Brown
(Faction, Poetry & Film), and Andrew Brown (Music, Letters, Cartoons).
London: P.P. Layouts, Vol. 1 no. 1 (Nov.1975-Jan. 1976)

\

Abs: “Other Times is an international *speculative* quarterly. Sad as
this thin word seems, it at least defines our vices. Like Jean Harlow in
McClure’s ‘The Beard’ we have to say to you, “Before you can pry any
secrets from me, you must first find the real me! Which one will you
pursue?” We offer you in every issue some tactics, some strategy, some
method of inquiry. We offer you in every issue new destinations, some
diversions, some dead-ends. Which one you pursue is a matter of
beautiful indifference to us. We shall continue to massage the organs of
this media before your very eyes. We intend that something should happen
between your ears rather than the lobotomy others seek to engineer.” –
from the editorial, signed by “The Editors”. The magazine has fairly
high production values for its time, using black and white visuals
creatively and with a black, blue and white glossy cover. As the
editorial suggests it is characterised by eclecticism and it looks both
to America and the Continent, with not a little nod to Surrealism. Items
include a cartoon strip, short fiction, Eric Mottram on “Dionysus in
America”, and essay on the film-maker Georges Mélièse, and poems by
Blaise Cendrars translated by Peter Hoida. The name of the publisher,
P.P. Layouts, is a jokey reference to the sinister corporation in Philip
K. Dick’s novel *The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch*. Perhaps the
editor’s name, “Mr. E.”, is also an in-joke of this kind.

heritage, to a living language, to a living community.” Contributors

poetry and reviewing their books, to inform English readers about poetry
in the Welsh language, and to place the poetry of Wales in a broader
international context.” Later editors included: Gerald Morgan; Sam
Adams; Mike Jenkins; J.P. Ward; Cary Archard; Richard Poole; Bryan
Aspden; Paul Henry; Duncan Bush; and Robert Minhinnick. Numerous special
issues have appeared, including those on R.S. Thomas, Vernon Watkins,

\

Abs: An extraordinarily international poetry magazine, including work
from Brazil, Russia, Cuba, the United States, France, England and
Scotland: at turns interested in sound, visual, futurist, objectivist,
concrete and minimalist poetry, not to mention art and photography; and,
as with almost all Finlay productions, executed with style and a light
touch. The first issue was edited by “J. McGuffie and P. Pond”, and
subsequent issues anonymously, but it is assumed that Finlay was the
main editor. There appear to have been two different versions of no. 2,
both of which are held by the National Library of Scotland. As well as
Finlay himself, contributors include George Mackay Brown, Robert
Garioch, Douglas Young, Tom McGrath, Helen Cruickshank, Edwin Morgan,
Crombie Saunders, J. F. Hendry, D. M. Black, Mayakovsky, Attila József,
Robert Lax, Ronald Johnson and Edgard Braga, as well as the artists Ad
Reinhardt, Charles Biederman, Bridget Riley, John Furnival and Emil
Antonucci. Reinhardt and Biederman are both represented by art theory.

\

Abs: “PRIAPUS, a magazine of poetry and art, was begun in 1962 by John
Cotton and Ted Walker, who were working at that time in Southall at the
Grammar Technical School. […] In its time PRIAPUS printed the first
published poems of its two founders and the first or early poems of D.
M. Thomas, Miles Burrows, Gerda Mayer, Norman Jackson, Sally Purcell,
Peter Jay, Paul Coltman, Peter Cundall, John Mole, Peter Scupham, Wes
Magee, W. G. Shepherd, Christopher Pilling, Roger Iredale and others now
well known in their own right. […] Covers were designed and printed by
Oscar Mellor at his Fantasy Press and by Alan Tarling at the Poet and
Printer Press, and art work was supplied by Oscar Mellor, Michael
Markham, Heinke Jenkins and Jack Yates amongst others. Then with PRIAPUS
9, in the Summer of 1967, Rigby Graham joined forces with us and the art
began to rival the poetry as our reason for existence.” - John Cotton,
from the last issue.

London: No. 1 (1970)-7? (1974?)

\

Abs: Halfway between a magazine and a pamphlet series, each issue with
its own title. After the first two issues, which had a selection of
different authors, no. 1 titled *Tramps*, no. 2 *Zusammen*, issues
tended to be given over to a single author’s work, e.g. no. 3 was
McCarthy’s *Erire*, with drawings by Nuttall.

as Roy Fisher*,* *Ten Interiors with Various Figures* (1966), BL:
YA.1987.a.9983. It also published the more substantial magazine
*Tarasque*.

\

Abs: Many of these one-sheet issues took the form of instructions and
exercises, adopting the tone of the first issue which declared,
“Assuming from the onset that the reader has little or no grounding in
literature we will commence and continue in a very direct manner.” This
was matched by the design of the masthead which featured a red L sign
for Learner. The intention seems to have been to encourage poets to read
more poetry and to read more critically. By issue four, the lessons on
Hopkins and Logue etc. had been replaced by a sole photograph of some
rocks; issue five was a poem by Edwin Morgan about “Making a Poem”;
later numbers had texts by Stephen Bann, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Simon
Cutts and Stuart Mills. Edited anonymously, from the Trent Book Shop.

Abs: A magazine whose first series published several significant
American poets - Zukofsky, Olson, Corman, Oppen, Eigner, Creeley, Thomas
Clark and Gary Snyder - as well as Charles Tomlinson, Gael Turnbull,
Anselm Hollo, Roy Fisher, Jim Burns, Paul Evans, Barry McSweeny [as

published from Cambridge had a greater ‘Cambridge school’ focus, with
poets including Peter Riley, Douglas Oliver, Wendy Mulford, Gill
Vickers, J. H. Prynne, John James, Tim Longville, Andrew Crozier, David
Chaloner, John Riley, Chris Torrance, Tom Raworth and others. An archive
of poems and correspondence relating to the second series is held at
Lilly Library, Indiana University. The cover design of most issues in
both series involved a striking use of black and white: this was a
stylish little magazine, inside and out. C. I. McNeill was only
editorially involved in the first issue of the first series: James and

number of special issues, e.g., on Eliot (no. 4, Nov. 1962), on William
Empson (No. 6/7, June 1963), on the Black Mountain poets (no. 10, Summer
1964), and the last issue published the contributions of many poets on
the theme, “The State of Poetry - A Symposium”. Some issues were part of
a Pamphlet Series, e.g. no. 13 comprises Antonio Machado, *The Garden in
the Evening*, tr. Colin Falck. Also involved editorially: Colin Falck,

Contributors include C. L. R. James, Mervyn Morris, Aimé Cesaire, Derek
Walcott, James Berry, John Figueroa, Linton Kwesi Johnson, E. A.
Markham, Judy Miles, Stuart Hall, V. S. Naipaul, and others. The

Note: Title varies with each issue, e.g. French Schmuck, General
Schmuck, Teutonic Schmuck, Aktual Schmuck Czechoslovakia, Schmuck
Iceland, Hungarian Schmuck, Japanese Schmuck. Some issues appear to have
formed part of a wider monographic series “Schmuck anthological”.

\

Abs: A note on the website of the Department of Special Collections and
University Archives, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford,
California, where a Beau Geste Press archive is held, summarises the
project: “The Beau Geste Press existed in England between 1971-1974. It
was founded by Felipe Ehrenberg, David Mayor, Chris Welch, and Martha
Hellion. It printed the works of visual poets, conceptualists, and
neo-dadaists, many of whom were closely tied to the Fluxus movement. The
press printed artist books using inexpensive materials, such as
mimeograph machines, cheap paper, and staples. In 1974 the Beau Geste
Press merged with several similar presses to form BAAA, the Beau and
Aloes Arc Association.” *Schmuck* itself seems to have been a project to
collect avant-garde poems and other short texts, especially visual and
paper-engineered work from the particular country named in the title.
The primary Beau Geste archive is held in the archives of Tate Britain,
London.

Britain a Government, mass media, and much of the available Press and
publishing - among other things. There is discontent with the
consequences of this situation for Scotland. As witness Hamilton and
other SNP successes. One must neither underrate nor exaggerate what this
unease means. The shared interests and culture form part of the terms
within which people are now living in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
Dundee and other places. It is with these people, defined in these
terms, that our story begins.” - from the first editorial. Open to all
the issues and arts in Scotland and with a very strong poetry presence.

Issue 21 ran to 268 in B-format with a circulation of 2,500. It was
*the* British poetry magazine of the period featuring most UK writers
and leavened with Americans and with Europeans in translation. The
magazine had a strong leaning towards the innovative and regularly
included concrete and experimental works in its pages. A great strength
was *The Small Press Scene*, a vast and comprehensive round-up of
activity among poetry and alternative publishers world-wide.” - From

Léger, Jack and W. B. Yeats, and especially Anthony Cronin. The magazine
is characterised by fairly long essays on all the arts, including

\

Abs: Poems and reviews within a friendly, chatty context. Aesthetically
conservative. In no. 60 (Autumn 1966), which marks an upgrade in
production values to a commercially printed format, it is described as
the “oldest duplicated magazine in the U.K.” The earliest issues were
described as “folios”, and the magazine as being “the organ of the
Outsiders Forum”. More well-known contributors include: Peter Finch,
Eric Ratcliffe, Terry Kingham, Tony Curtis, R. L. Cook, Wes Magee,
Lawrence Upton, Steve Sneyd and Brian Louis Pearce. Regular contributors
who seem particularly associated with the magazine include: Ken Price,
Ian Caws, Doris Corti, Honor Butlin, Helen Shaw, and John Wiltshire.

a Marxist analysis, and to encourage free and original expression by the
class members.” Many of the earlier contributors were from this English
class but the magazine encouraged new writers.

\

Abs: Experimental magazine, presenting half a dozen or so sequences of
poetry and other texts and visuals in each issue. The first number was
edited anonymously, after which the contributors were described as the
“contributing editors” to each issue. It was an A4 stapled, mimeographed
publication with a wrap-around cover consisting of a sheet of wallpaper.
Despite the mimeo format, the range of visuals and other formal elements
suggests a sophisticated and steady art direction to the magazine, and
the poetry reflects this cerebral, avant-garde approach. An interest in
the permutational suggests affinities at least with Oulipo, but, as the
*Wallpaper* cassette makes explicit, there is also an interest in sound
and performance. Contributors came from the world of poetry, drama,
music, visual art, sculpture, and sociology, and included: Richard
Quarrell, Amikam Toren, David Coxhead, Anthony Howell, John Welch,
Anthony McCall, Andrew Eden, Richard Bernas, Susan Hiller, Bill
Shepherd, Susan Bonvin and others.

\

Abs: “This issue of the *Women’s Liberation Review* grew out of a
workshop on Women and Literature at the Women’s Liberation Conference in
Manchester (March, 1972). Most of us were women writing in the isolation
of our own homes who wanted to share our experiences, communicate our
ideas. All of us were women who felt the need for our movement to
generate its own body of literature in response to our situation. A
Women’s Literature Collective which would work together to create an
anthology of women’s writings seemed to answer both these needs.” – from
the anonymous editorial in the first issue. Poems, political essays and
literary criticism, illustrations, photographs, and personal testimony.

Website: Information on several of the issues is given on Andrew

British Poetry* (Cambridge: Salt, 2003)

\

Abs: Beginning as a magazine of the Islington Poetry Workshop, *Angel
Exhaust* developed beyond this small group by increasing the number of
experimental poems from across Britain and carrying intellectual if
sometimes intense reviews and essays, notably by Andrew Duncan. It
became a key magazine for various British avant-gardes. The first two
issues were edited by Steven Pereira with production by Jenny Pereira,
joined in the third issue by Adrian Clarke as co-editor. Clarke and
Steven Pereira co-edited until their last issue, no. 7 (Summer 1987),
after which the characteristic A4 typescript format was dropped forever.
No. 8 was a perfect-bound A5 ‘book’, surfacing after a five year break
(Autumn 1992) with Pereira replaced by Andrew Duncan, though still with
Clarke as co-editor. Scott Thurston joined them for no. 9 (Summer 1993),
and Macdonald and Gardiner joined the team on no. 10 (Spring 1994). By
no. 12 Duncan was editing alone, but he was joined by Simon Smith for
no. 16. In 1999, what looked like the last issue, no. 17, was guest
edited by Maurice Scully and John Goodby, a feature on Irish modernist
poetry. However, Duncan returned with co-editor Charles Bainbridge to
resurrect the magazine in 2005 with the 18^th^ issue.

Abs: “The policy of this magazine is to publish poetry and prose of an
aesthetic that relates firstly to the tradition of English Lyrical
Poetry, particularly with regard to the tone adopted by the poet, and by
his choice of subject matter. In the lyric, life is approached primarily
from a joyous, celebratory point of view. The stance adopted by the poet
is: ‘I sing about...’ Herrick’s introduction to ‘Hesperides’ is a very
good example of this.” – Astrid Wilson, in the first issue. Other
acknowledged points of reference include Imagism, Concrete Poetry, and
the writers linked with Tarasque Press, *Aggie Weston’s* and Coracle
Press (Simon Cutts, Stuart Mills and others).

poetry is and will be printed, only poetry of a decadent nature, or work
by new and exciting poets (excite:- to rouse emotion, agitate, to stir
up, to produce electric or magnetic activity.) will be featured. As far
as artists are concerned, all I can say is that I am disappointed.”

using a number of original *Bogg* contributors, including George
Cairncross and Steve Sneyd. The editorial for the first issue states:
“Yes, dear Readers, poetry should be fun, not locked up in the
Universities and Colleges, to be dissected by the Profs and students; it
should be writ large on the street hoardings, scrawled across the
pavements, recited at madcap parties, given free with the cornflakes,
printed on bogg rolls: in fact it should be everywhere to be enjoyed and
laughed over by everyone.”

Abs: With the tagline “Bringing water to the seed”, there was a strong

R. S. Thomas, Denise Levertov, Bill Wyatt, Paul Green, David Miller, Sue
Arengo, Elizabeth Smither and others, with translations of Rilke (by
Roger Thorp) and Francis Ponge (by Peter Hoy). Thorp’s background in
visual art was evident in his inclusion of artwork as well as in the
design of the magazine. Michael Thorp’s *Cloud* project arguably found
its main realisation in the books and pamphlets in the *Cloudforms* and
*Markings* series which succeeded the magazine itself.

Abs: Writing for the stuckism.com website, the artist Charles Thomson
recalls that Outcrowd was originally a reading series organised by Rob
Earl and Bill Lewis in Maidstone, emerging out of a Medway scene
connected to Medway College in Chatham and Maidstone College of Art.
This would later lead later in the 1980s to a group known as The Medway
Poets, anthologised by Thomson’s Cheapo imprint and recorded on Billy
Childish’s label, Hangman Records (British Library Sound Archive:
1LP0006631). Tracy Emin was part of this milieu. Also part of the scene
were the presses and record labels set up by Billy Childish (Hangman
Press and Hangman Records), Bill Lewis (Lazerwolf Press), and Charles
Thomson (Cheapo Press). The Medway scene was also later involved with
the art movement Stuckism.

Website: www.englit.ed.ac.uk/edinburghreview/

#### Abs: “Scotland’s leading journal of ideas, the *Edinburgh Review* publishes essays, short fiction, poetry and reviews aimed at an educated reading public with an interest in critical thought” – from the website (Oct. 2004). Referring back to the nineteenth century *Edinburgh Review* (BL: P.P. 6199.h), edited most famously by Francis Jeffrey, the new magazine attempted to make a similar cultural intervention. It was politically and philosophically internationalist in outlook from the outset, with writers as diverse as Kathy Acker, the Salvadorean Roque Dalton, Michel Foucault and Christa Wolf appearing alongside contemporary Scottish writers. Despite the Edinburgh location, the *Review* was perhaps most significant in its first decade as a publisher of Glasgow-based writers, several of whose work emerged to transform the Scottish literary landscape, particularly in fiction. As well as Alasdair Gray, writers associated with the Glasgow renaissance included James Kelman, Janice Galloway, Agnes Owens, A. L. Kennedy, Jeff Torrington, Frank Kuppner, Tom Leonard, Peter McCarey and Alan Riach (whose collaborative piece *For What It Is* was published in no. 72), Edwin Morgan, David Kinloch, and others. {.western lang="en-GB"}

\

Related Imprint: Mermaid Turbulence publishes artists’ books and other

Website: www.mermaidturbulence.com/

\

Abs: Paperback format for this attractively produced little magazine.
Djeribi’s first editorial announces that *Element* is “a literary
journal with contributions from all over the world – arranged in
alphabetical order – and a cooking recipe at the end.” The range of work
is international, with conventional, experimental, and translated texts
and visuals interspersing each other. There’s a light touch to the
editing, as the recipe pledge suggests – a promise which is kept
throughout the series (no. 8 by 2002) – and the context is as much
visual arts and book arts as poetry or fiction. After the second issue
has its own theme: no. 3, All Food Matters; no. 4, Exit, Escape, Exiles;
no. 5, The Enemy; no. 6, Space; no. 7, What Machines?; Hoarders,
Collectors. The more literary contributors include Al Berto, Nuno
Júdice, and Sophia de Mello Breyner (each translated from the Portuguese
by Richard Zimler), Ciaran Carson, Tom McIntyre and Derek Mahon
(translating Philippe Jaccottet).

Abs: Fire “is radical, multicultural and international in outlook, and
publishes a broad range of poetry from around the world. It tends
towards the more alternative end of the poetry spectrum, and is
interested in poetry with heart, spirit, imagination, innovation,
risk-taking, open-endedness, and most of all poems that have something
to say. Not neat, tight, closed, clever, cynical, fashionable poems.” –

\

Abs: As the title implies, designed to encourage new authors. No. 19
(Autumn 1990) reprints a letter from a Literature Officer of the Arts
Council of Great Britain, declining to fund the magazine on the grounds
that the quality of material was low, that too little funding was being
requested (the Arts Council tending only to fund larger projects), and
that *First Time* should address the problem of its too low cover price
(at the time £2). Included in the same issue, among various but formally
conservative verse, were poems from Laura Hird and Toby Litt, later
better known as novelists. The magazine survived for many further
issues.

Riach and Price himself. Elizabeth James and Leona Medlin, also
published in *Gairfish*, each had single-author collections from Vennel
Press as well.

\

Abs: “Gairfish is dedicated to publishing creative work in all the
languages of Scotland. It is also committed to the radical reappraisal
of Scottish culture without adherence to any faction, political or
otherwise. However, Gairfish does not consider its rubric to be limited
to Scottish writers or affairs: its aim is the greatest plurality
possible stemming from a Scottish base.” – the paragraph used on several
issues to describe its policy. The highpoint of the magazine was
probably vol. 5 (1992), “The McAvantgarde” issue, which contains
contributions by a range of Scottish poets including D. M. Black
(writing on the Scottish avant-garde in the 1960s), Maoilios Cambeul,
Robert Crawford (an essay, “Thoughts on a Scottish Literary
Avant-Garde), Graham Fulton, Tom Hubbard, Kathleen Jamie, Robert Alan
Jamieson, David Kinloch (on the use of the Scots language in his
poetry), Frank Kuppner, Tom Leonard, Peter McCarey, Duncan McGibbon, Tom
McGrath, John Manson, W. S. Milne, Edwin Morgan, Pseudorca (i.e. W. N.
Herbert), Alan Riach (on “Tradition and the New Alliance: Scotland and
the Caribbean”), Kenneth White (an essay, “The Nomadist Manifesto”), and
a short essay by the artist George Wyllie on Scotland and the visual
arts. Vol. 8, “Calemadonnas: Women & Scotland”, guest-edited by Helen
Kidd, includes a memoir of Cambridge School poet Veronica
Forrest-Thompson by Wendy Mulford. W.N. Herbert solo-edited Vol. 9,
“Overspill”.

Abs: Perhaps only a true little magazine in its early stages, in that,
after being founded by postgraduates, it soon became a commercial
journal with considerable financial backing and mainstream distribution.
Nevertheless, drawing on its university association and the reputation
of its predecessor *The Granta*, ** which ran from 1899 to 1973 (BL:
PP.6058.i.), it is sometimes mentioned as a little magazine in the
national press. It is included here on that basis. It has been a pioneer
of fiction, non-fiction, and documentary photography, and its
contributors include: Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Saul Bellow, Peter
Carey, Raymond Carver, Angela Carter, Bruce Chatwin, James Fenton,
Richard Ford, Martha Gellhorn, Nadine Gordimer, Romesh Gunesekera, Milan
Kundera, Doris Lessing, Ian McEwan, Blake Morrison, Gabriel Garcia
Márquez, Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie, Zadie Smith, George Steiner,
Graham Swift, Paul Theroux, Edmund White, Jeanette Winterson, Tobias
Wolff and others. Its Best of British Young Novelists campaigns have
helped the reputations of many British writers.

Abs: *Grille*, or ‘GRI*ll*E’ as Simon Smith preferred (perhaps
emphasising a geometric shape in keeping with the title), was produced
simply and inexpensively. It was notable for its diverse range of
contributors within a broad context of what was then termed
linguistically innovative poetry (experimental, avant-garde etc.).
Contributors included Lee Harwood, Peter Riley, Iain Sinclair, Denise
Riley, John Welch, Tony Lopez, Peter Larkin, Maurice Scully, Kelvin
Corcoran, Alan Halsey, Robert Hampson, Ken Edwards, Harry Gilonis,
Andrew Duncan, Anthony Mellors and David Rees. It also included
translations of Andrea Zanzotto (by Anthony Barnett with Claire Jakens)
and André du Bouchet (by George Messo). The title was derived from
*Speech-Grille*, the title (in English translation) of one of German
poet Paul Celan’s best-known collections.

Abs: From the website: “HRAFNHOH, adapted from Anglo-Saxon HRÆFN, a
raven, and HOH, a hill-spur, comes from the original form of RAINOW HILL
near CONGLETON, at the edge of BIDDULPH parish, Staffordshire. A study
of the surname and place of Biddulph and the origin of surnames and of
placenames was the starting point of this fascinating compilation of
bygones and origins, heraldic and hereditary bits and pieces, combined
with measured poetry and reviews, social comment, philosophy, and
erudite meanderings. In its own rather miscellaneous way, \`Hrafnhoh’ is
a magazine dedicated to the intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual
development of its readers: almost denomination-blind, it encourages an

and writing, not only in Britain but internationally.” Although there
were always visuals used in the magazine, the occasional article on art,

the heart of the magazine was poetry. The editorial style was eclectic,

Abs: “We look for poems which give a direct sense of what it is to live
today – honest about feelings, alert about world, sometimes funny,
always well crafted. When we decided on the title *Magma*, it was to
suggest the molten core within the world, hidden as deep feelings are
and showing itself in unpredictable movements, tremors, lava flows,
eruptions.” – from the website, Nov. 2004. Unusual in that each issue
has a different editor, on a rotating basis. The magazine launches each
issue with a reading, often at the Troubadour Coffee House, Earls Court.

involved in the series, and by the often beautiful design of each issue.

interactions between text and art, as well as an emphasis on poetry in
translation. Most issues consisted of a single folded sheet in an
envelope, often with an additional enclosure, usually also a single
sheet (e.g. an essay on the featured poet). Many issues featured a
single poet or writer in collaboration or conjunction with an artist,
but there were also anthology issues. Poets published in the series
include Robert Lax, Thomas A. Clark, Frank Samperi, Ian Hamilton Finlay,
Robert Creeley, Ian Stephen and Norma Cole. There were also translations
by Cid Corman (Santoka and Masaoka Shiki), Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre
Joris (Kurt Schwitters), Edwin Morgan (Attila József), Rosmarie Waldrop
(Friederike Mayröcker) and others. Artists included Sol Le Witt, Jess
[Collins], Hans Waanders, David Connearn, Ron Costley and Andrew Bick.

Abs: Modelled on *The Welsh Review* (1939-1948) and *Dock Leaves* and
its successor *Anglo-Welsh Review* (1949-1988). “Each issue – which
features a whole host of writing talent, from the literary heavy-
weights to rising new stars – includes a range of critical articles,
book reviews, fiction and poetry. Engagingly written, visually
attractive and intellectually ambitious, *New Welsh Review* casts a
challenging, exuberant eye over the literary scene in Wales. While the
magazine’s focus is on Welsh writing in English, its outlook is
deliberately cosmopolitan, encompassing broader European and
international literary contexts.”- from the Website, Dec. 2004.
Contributors include the poets Sheenagh Pugh, Ruth Bidgood, Stephen
Knight, Tiffany Atkinson and Christopher Meredith.

Abs: “We are expressing our right to differ. We are a protest against
monopoly and hype. We believe there are many good poems which may not
conform to current trends, and we want to see these poems brought into
daylight. We believe it is important to maintain outlets, however small,
where work can be judged, not by whether it is commercial or
fashionable, but by whether it is the authentic stuff of life - perhaps
not for everybody, but for somebody; where the work of an unknown writer
has as good a chance as that of the established.” - From Evangeline
Paterson’s editorial, vol. 2 no. 1 (1995). After more than a five-year
break, the magazine re-started in 1995 in Benton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
attracting funding from Northern Arts by 1996.

Abs: “The journal aims to develop discussion of the legacies of
modernism, refusing to characterise modernism as that which is simply
past while providing a forum for the discussion and debate of
contemporary writing and critical theory.” – from the website, Jan.
2005. Contributors include: Denise Riley, Simon Smith, Wendy Mulford,
Douglas Oliver, Alice Notley, Fanny Howe, Michael Haslam, Edwin Morgan,
Andrew Duncan, Charles Bernstein, Out to Lunch, Ralph Hawkins, Aaron
Williamson, Peter Manson, Peter Finch, Miles Champion, Scott Thurston,

Peter Russell, Peter Larkin, J. H. Prynne, D. S. Marriott, Anthony
Mellors, John Wilkinson, Alan Marshall, Tony Lopez, Richard Makin, Simon
Perrill, and others. The first three issues were edited by Simon Jarvis
and Drew Milne, but later ones by Milne alone. The cover of no. 5 uses a
pastiche of Russian Futurist graphic design to refer to the Cambridge
Conference on Contemporary Poetry (thus, CCCP). No. 6 adopts a
*Blast*-like use of typography to “blast” Kambridge (Milne was then at
the University of Sussex), and to Bless “All who sail in US”. No. 7
(Spring 1995) was guest edited by J. H. Prynne, with translations by
Jeff Twitchell and entitled ‘Original: Chinese Language Poetry Group’.
After 8/9 (1996) there was a long gap, with no. 10 appearing only in
2001.

Abs: “Editorial policy is imaginary and does not exist. I exist. The
next Rabies issue will be identical to the one following it. There will
not be an issue 3. Nothing new will be published because it’s all old
hat.” –from the first issue. This is a magazine which takes its bearings
from Dada and Surrealism. There are swipes at Barry MacSweeney (against
his poetry and against his chairmanship of the Poetry Society), Marina
Vaisey (the art critic of *The Times*), an un-named poet (“a blubbering
mess such as the Quartermass of Yorkshire [who] turns its clumsy
attention to the task of crying more copiously in verse than any one
else and getting away with it”), Emma Tennant and *Bananas* (“the
Illiterary Newspaper”), Kingsley Amis (his imaginary answers to an
Intelligence Test), and the forty poets, many of them conventionally
regarded as avant-garde, attending the Cambridge Poetry Festival 1977.
There are some manifestoes (including one for Dataism), and poems by
Kelly and Paul Brown.

The UVVA exists to explore, celebrate, and question the works and lives

Abs: The magazine Tony Frazer set up after *Imprint*. From his editorial
statement at poetrymagazines.org.uk: “If the journal has a ruling
aesthetic, it is one informed by international modernism and by the more
radical kinds of poetry that appeared in the USA and the UK in the 1950s
and 1960s.” Featured poets have included David Jaffin, Emmanuel
Hocquard, Marcelin Pleynet, Harry Guest, Peter Dent, Simon Perchik,
Andrew Duncan, Clive Faust, Nathaniel Tarn and Peter Riley. Other poets
who have been appeared in the magazine include Gustaf Sobin, Guy
Birchard, John Levy, Craig Watson, Laurie Duggan, Gael Turnbull,
Christopher Middleton, Kelvin Corcoran, Trevor Joyce, Peter Larkin,
Frances Presley, Tilla Brading, Ian Davidson, Andy Brown, Rupert M.
Loydell, Martin Anderson, Tim Allen and David Miller. Earlier issues
have been digitized and appear on the Poetry Library’s magazines site,
www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/, while more recent ones appear on the
Shearsman site itself.

**747 Slow Dancer** / edited by John Harvey. London, then Nottingham:
Slow Dancer Press, No. 1 (1977)-30 (Summer 1993). ISSN: 0143-1412

\

Profiled in: John Harvey, “Last Chance for a Slow Dance”, *Poetry
London*, reproduced in full at www.mellotone.co.uk

Related Imprint: Slow Dancer Press published many poetry collections,
including work by Simon Armitage, Lee Harwood, Libby Houston and James
Schuyler

Website: www.mellotone.co.uk

\

Abs: From “Last Chance for a Slow Dance”, Harvey records: “From the
first, there was a strong bias towards American poetry, either written
by Americans themselves, or by those of us whose work showed, in some
respects, an American influence. […] Slow Dancer favoured poems whose
language was direct and colloquial, rather than couched in ‘poetic
diction,’ which were narrative rather than purely lyric (and certainly
not epic!) and which eschewed references to Greek deities or ancient
mythologies.” The magazine emerged from a series of workshops held by
John Harvey, Tina Fulker, Alan Brooks, and Annie Gilligan, themselves
influenced by courses held by the Arvon Foundation. Some issues were
given over to specific subjects, e.g. no. 15, American issue,
guest-edited by Alan Brooks; 27, a Sharon Olds issue; 29, a North
American issue, guest-edited by Rhona McAdam. The editor is best known
as the author of the crime novels which feature the Nottingham-based
detective Charlie Resnick.

submitted without the name of the poet on them, to avoid bias. Each

1997 each issue features a southern poet with an essay about him or her
and a selection of their poetry. Relaunched in 2003 following the
withdrawal of funding for Word & Action.
