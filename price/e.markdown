Website: Information on several of the issues is given on Andrew

British Poetry* (Cambridge: Salt, 2003)

\

Abs: Beginning as a magazine of the Islington Poetry Workshop, *Angel
Exhaust* developed beyond this small group by increasing the number of
experimental poems from across Britain and carrying intellectual if
sometimes intense reviews and essays, notably by Andrew Duncan. It
became a key magazine for various British avant-gardes. The first two
issues were edited by Steven Pereira with production by Jenny Pereira,
joined in the third issue by Adrian Clarke as co-editor. Clarke and
Steven Pereira co-edited until their last issue, no. 7 (Summer 1987),
after which the characteristic A4 typescript format was dropped forever.
No. 8 was a perfect-bound A5 ‘book’, surfacing after a five year break
(Autumn 1992) with Pereira replaced by Andrew Duncan, though still with
Clarke as co-editor. Scott Thurston joined them for no. 9 (Summer 1993),
and Macdonald and Gardiner joined the team on no. 10 (Spring 1994). By
no. 12 Duncan was editing alone, but he was joined by Simon Smith for
no. 16. In 1999, what looked like the last issue, no. 17, was guest
edited by Maurice Scully and John Goodby, a feature on Irish modernist
poetry. However, Duncan returned with co-editor Charles Bainbridge to
resurrect the magazine in 2005 with the 18^th^ issue.

Abs: “The policy of this magazine is to publish poetry and prose of an
aesthetic that relates firstly to the tradition of English Lyrical
Poetry, particularly with regard to the tone adopted by the poet, and by
his choice of subject matter. In the lyric, life is approached primarily
from a joyous, celebratory point of view. The stance adopted by the poet
is: ‘I sing about...’ Herrick’s introduction to ‘Hesperides’ is a very
good example of this.” – Astrid Wilson, in the first issue. Other
acknowledged points of reference include Imagism, Concrete Poetry, and
the writers linked with Tarasque Press, *Aggie Weston’s* and Coracle
Press (Simon Cutts, Stuart Mills and others).

poetry is and will be printed, only poetry of a decadent nature, or work
by new and exciting poets (excite:- to rouse emotion, agitate, to stir
up, to produce electric or magnetic activity.) will be featured. As far

Abs: A magazine that tried to recapture the spirit of *Bogg*, notably by
using a number of original *Bogg* contributors, including George
Cairncross and Steve Sneyd. The editorial for the first issue states:
“Yes, dear Readers, poetry should be fun, not locked up in the
Universities and Colleges, to be dissected by the Profs and students; it
should be writ large on the street hoardings, scrawled across the
pavements, recited at madcap parties, given free with the cornflakes,
printed on bogg rolls: in fact it should be everywhere to be enjoyed and
laughed over by everyone.”

Abs: With the tagline “Bringing water to the seed”, there was a strong
spiritual element to the writing in this magazine. Contributors included
R. S. Thomas, Denise Levertov, Bill Wyatt, Paul Green, David Miller, Sue
Arengo, Elizabeth Smither and others, with translations of Rilke (by
Roger Thorp) and Francis Ponge (by Peter Hoy). Thorp’s background in
visual art was evident in his inclusion of artwork as well as in the
design of the magazine. Michael Thorp’s *Cloud* project arguably found
its main realisation in the books and pamphlets in the *Cloudforms* and
*Markings* series which succeeded the magazine itself.

Abs: Writing for the stuckism.com website, the artist Charles Thomson
recalls that Outcrowd was originally a reading series organised by Rob
Earl and Bill Lewis in Maidstone, emerging out of a Medway scene
connected to Medway College in Chatham and Maidstone College of Art.
This would later lead later in the 1980s to a group known as The Medway
Poets, anthologised by Thomson’s Cheapo imprint and recorded on Billy
Childish’s label, Hangman Records (British Library Sound Archive:
1LP0006631). Tracy Emin was part of this milieu. Also part of the scene
were the presses and record labels set up by Billy Childish (Hangman
Press and Hangman Records), Bill Lewis (Lazerwolf Press), and Charles
Thomson (Cheapo Press). The Medway scene was also later involved with
the art movement Stuckism.

#### Abs: “Scotland’s leading journal of ideas, the *Edinburgh Review* publishes essays, short fiction, poetry and reviews aimed at an educated reading public with an interest in critical thought” – from the website (Oct. 2004). Referring back to the nineteenth century *Edinburgh Review* (BL: P.P. 6199.h), edited most famously by Francis Jeffrey, the new magazine attempted to make a similar cultural intervention. It was politically and philosophically internationalist in outlook from the outset, with writers as diverse as Kathy Acker, the Salvadorean Roque Dalton, Michel Foucault and Christa Wolf appearing alongside contemporary Scottish writers. Despite the Edinburgh location, the *Review* was perhaps most significant in its first decade as a publisher of Glasgow-based writers, several of whose work emerged to transform the Scottish literary landscape, particularly in fiction. As well as Alasdair Gray, writers associated with the Glasgow renaissance included James Kelman, Janice Galloway, Agnes Owens, A. L. Kennedy, Jeff Torrington, Frank Kuppner, Tom Leonard, Peter McCarey and Alan Riach (whose collaborative piece *For What It Is* was published in no. 72), Edwin Morgan, David Kinloch, and others. {.western lang="en-GB"}

\

Related Imprint: Mermaid Turbulence publishes artists’ books and other

Website: www.mermaidturbulence.com/

\

Abs: Paperback format for this attractively produced little magazine.
Djeribi’s first editorial announces that *Element* is “a literary
journal with contributions from all over the world – arranged in
alphabetical order – and a cooking recipe at the end.” The range of work
is international, with conventional, experimental, and translated texts
and visuals interspersing each other. There’s a light touch to the
editing, as the recipe pledge suggests – a promise which is kept
throughout the series (no. 8 by 2002) – and the context is as much
visual arts and book arts as poetry or fiction. After the second issue
has its own theme: no. 3, All Food Matters; no. 4, Exit, Escape, Exiles;
no. 5, The Enemy; no. 6, Space; no. 7, What Machines?; Hoarders,
Collectors. The more literary contributors include Al Berto, Nuno
Júdice, and Sophia de Mello Breyner (each translated from the Portuguese
by Richard Zimler), Ciaran Carson, Tom McIntyre and Derek Mahon
(translating Philippe Jaccottet).

Abs: Fire “is radical, multicultural and international in outlook, and
publishes a broad range of poetry from around the world. It tends
towards the more alternative end of the poetry spectrum, and is
interested in poetry with heart, spirit, imagination, innovation,
risk-taking, open-endedness, and most of all poems that have something
to say. Not neat, tight, closed, clever, cynical, fashionable poems.” –

Website: www.josephineaustin.co.uk/

\

Abs: As the title implies, designed to encourage new authors. No. 19
(Autumn 1990) reprints a letter from a Literature Officer of the Arts
Council of Great Britain, declining to fund the magazine on the grounds
that the quality of material was low, that too little funding was being
requested (the Arts Council tending only to fund larger projects), and
that *First Time* should address the problem of its too low cover price
(at the time £2). Included in the same issue, among various but formally
conservative verse, were poems from Laura Hird and Toby Litt, later
better known as novelists. The magazine survived for many further
issues.

Riach and Price himself. Elizabeth James and Leona Medlin, also
published in *Gairfish*, each had single-author collections from Vennel
Press as well.

\

Abs: “Gairfish is dedicated to publishing creative work in all the
languages of Scotland. It is also committed to the radical reappraisal
of Scottish culture without adherence to any faction, political or
otherwise. However, Gairfish does not consider its rubric to be limited
to Scottish writers or affairs: its aim is the greatest plurality
possible stemming from a Scottish base.” – the paragraph used on several
issues to describe its policy. The highpoint of the magazine was
probably vol. 5 (1992), “The McAvantgarde” issue, which contains
contributions by a range of Scottish poets including D. M. Black
(writing on the Scottish avant-garde in the 1960s), Maoilios Cambeul,
Robert Crawford (an essay, “Thoughts on a Scottish Literary
Avant-Garde), Graham Fulton, Tom Hubbard, Kathleen Jamie, Robert Alan
Jamieson, David Kinloch (on the use of the Scots language in his
poetry), Frank Kuppner, Tom Leonard, Peter McCarey, Duncan McGibbon, Tom
McGrath, John Manson, W. S. Milne, Edwin Morgan, Pseudorca (i.e. W. N.
Herbert), Alan Riach (on “Tradition and the New Alliance: Scotland and
the Caribbean”), Kenneth White (an essay, “The Nomadist Manifesto”), and
a short essay by the artist George Wyllie on Scotland and the visual
arts. Vol. 8, “Calemadonnas: Women & Scotland”, guest-edited by Helen
Kidd, includes a memoir of Cambridge School poet Veronica
Forrest-Thompson by Wendy Mulford. W.N. Herbert solo-edited Vol. 9,
“Overspill”.

\

Abs: Perhaps only a true little magazine in its early stages, in that,
after being founded by postgraduates, it soon became a commercial
journal with considerable financial backing and mainstream distribution.
Nevertheless, drawing on its university association and the reputation
of its predecessor *The Granta*, ** which ran from 1899 to 1973 (BL:
PP.6058.i.), it is sometimes mentioned as a little magazine in the
national press. It is included here on that basis. It has been a pioneer
of fiction, non-fiction, and documentary photography, and its
contributors include: Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Saul Bellow, Peter
Carey, Raymond Carver, Angela Carter, Bruce Chatwin, James Fenton,
Richard Ford, Martha Gellhorn, Nadine Gordimer, Romesh Gunesekera, Milan
Kundera, Doris Lessing, Ian McEwan, Blake Morrison, Gabriel Garcia
Márquez, Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie, Zadie Smith, George Steiner,
Graham Swift, Paul Theroux, Edmund White, Jeanette Winterson, Tobias
Wolff and others. Its Best of British Young Novelists campaigns have
helped the reputations of many British writers.

Abs: *Grille*, or ‘GRI*ll*E’ as Simon Smith preferred (perhaps
emphasising a geometric shape in keeping with the title), was produced
simply and inexpensively. It was notable for its diverse range of
contributors within a broad context of what was then termed
linguistically innovative poetry (experimental, avant-garde etc.).
Contributors included Lee Harwood, Peter Riley, Iain Sinclair, Denise
Riley, John Welch, Tony Lopez, Peter Larkin, Maurice Scully, Kelvin
Corcoran, Alan Halsey, Robert Hampson, Ken Edwards, Harry Gilonis,
Andrew Duncan, Anthony Mellors and David Rees. It also included
translations of Andrea Zanzotto (by Anthony Barnett with Claire Jakens)
and André du Bouchet (by George Messo). The title was derived from
*Speech-Grille*, the title (in English translation) of one of German
poet Paul Celan’s best-known collections.

Abs: From the website: “HRAFNHOH, adapted from Anglo-Saxon HRÆFN, a
raven, and HOH, a hill-spur, comes from the original form of RAINOW HILL
near CONGLETON, at the edge of BIDDULPH parish, Staffordshire. A study
of the surname and place of Biddulph and the origin of surnames and of
placenames was the starting point of this fascinating compilation of
bygones and origins, heraldic and hereditary bits and pieces, combined
with measured poetry and reviews, social comment, philosophy, and
erudite meanderings. In its own rather miscellaneous way, \`Hrafnhoh’ is
a magazine dedicated to the intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual
development of its readers: almost denomination-blind, it encourages an
appreciation of authentic Christianity in its many manifestations: for
instance, issues have alluded to Primitive Methodist history,
monasticism, and Biblical study.”

**423 Kudos: poetry and art** / edited by Graham Sykes. Leeds: Kudos,
Issue 1 (1979)-12 (1982).

ISSN: 0143-4969

\

Abs: From the outset wishing “to become a focal point for modern poetry
and writing, not only in Britain but internationally.” Although there
were always visuals used in the magazine, the occasional article on art,

Abs: “We look for poems which give a direct sense of what it is to live
today – honest about feelings, alert about world, sometimes funny,
always well crafted. When we decided on the title *Magma*, it was to
suggest the molten core within the world, hidden as deep feelings are
and showing itself in unpredictable movements, tremors, lava flows,
eruptions.” – from the website, Nov. 2004. Unusual in that each issue
has a different editor, on a rotating basis. The magazine launches each
issue with a reading, often at the Troubadour Coffee House, Earls Court.

involved in the series, and by the often beautiful design of each issue.
Alec Finlay showed a preference for a sparely worded poetry and for
interactions between text and art, as well as an emphasis on poetry in
translation. Most issues consisted of a single folded sheet in an
envelope, often with an additional enclosure, usually also a single
sheet (e.g. an essay on the featured poet). Many issues featured a
single poet or writer in collaboration or conjunction with an artist,
but there were also anthology issues. Poets published in the series
include Robert Lax, Thomas A. Clark, Frank Samperi, Ian Hamilton Finlay,
Robert Creeley, Ian Stephen and Norma Cole. There were also translations
by Cid Corman (Santoka and Masaoka Shiki), Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre
Joris (Kurt Schwitters), Edwin Morgan (Attila József), Rosmarie Waldrop
(Friederike Mayröcker) and others. Artists included Sol Le Witt, Jess
[Collins], Hans Waanders, David Connearn, Ron Costley and Andrew Bick.

its successor *Anglo-Welsh Review* (1949-1988). “Each issue – which
features a whole host of writing talent, from the literary heavy-
weights to rising new stars – includes a range of critical articles,
book reviews, fiction and poetry. Engagingly written, visually
attractive and intellectually ambitious, *New Welsh Review* casts a
challenging, exuberant eye over the literary scene in Wales. While the
magazine’s focus is on Welsh writing in English, its outlook is
deliberately cosmopolitan, encompassing broader European and
international literary contexts.”- from the Website, Dec. 2004.
Contributors include the poets Sheenagh Pugh, Ruth Bidgood, Stephen
Knight, Tiffany Atkinson and Christopher Meredith.

Abs: “We are expressing our right to differ. We are a protest against
monopoly and hype. We believe there are many good poems which may not
conform to current trends, and we want to see these poems brought into
daylight. We believe it is important to maintain outlets, however small,
where work can be judged, not by whether it is commercial or
fashionable, but by whether it is the authentic stuff of life - perhaps
not for everybody, but for somebody; where the work of an unknown writer
has as good a chance as that of the established.” - From Evangeline
Paterson’s editorial, vol. 2 no. 1 (1995). After more than a five-year
break, the magazine re-started in 1995 in Benton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
attracting funding from Northern Arts by 1996.

Abs: “The journal aims to develop discussion of the legacies of
modernism, refusing to characterise modernism as that which is simply
past while providing a forum for the discussion and debate of
contemporary writing and critical theory.” – from the website, Jan.
2005. Contributors include: Denise Riley, Simon Smith, Wendy Mulford,
Douglas Oliver, Alice Notley, Fanny Howe, Michael Haslam, Edwin Morgan,
Andrew Duncan, Charles Bernstein, Out to Lunch, Ralph Hawkins, Aaron
Williamson, Peter Manson, Peter Finch, Miles Champion, Scott Thurston,

Peter Russell, Peter Larkin, J. H. Prynne, D. S. Marriott, Anthony
Mellors, John Wilkinson, Alan Marshall, Tony Lopez, Richard Makin, Simon
Perrill, and others. The first three issues were edited by Simon Jarvis
and Drew Milne, but later ones by Milne alone. The cover of no. 5 uses a
pastiche of Russian Futurist graphic design to refer to the Cambridge
Conference on Contemporary Poetry (thus, CCCP). No. 6 adopts a
*Blast*-like use of typography to “blast” Kambridge (Milne was then at
the University of Sussex), and to Bless “All who sail in US”. No. 7
(Spring 1995) was guest edited by J. H. Prynne, with translations by
Jeff Twitchell and entitled ‘Original: Chinese Language Poetry Group’.
After 8/9 (1996) there was a long gap, with no. 10 appearing only in
2001.

Abs: “Editorial policy is imaginary and does not exist. I exist. The
next Rabies issue will be identical to the one following it. There will
not be an issue 3. Nothing new will be published because it’s all old
hat.” –from the first issue. This is a magazine which takes its bearings
from Dada and Surrealism. There are swipes at Barry MacSweeney (against
his poetry and against his chairmanship of the Poetry Society), Marina
Vaisey (the art critic of *The Times*), an un-named poet (“a blubbering
mess such as the Quartermass of Yorkshire [who] turns its clumsy
attention to the task of crying more copiously in verse than any one
else and getting away with it”), Emma Tennant and *Bananas* (“the
Illiterary Newspaper”), Kingsley Amis (his imaginary answers to an
Intelligence Test), and the forty poets, many of them conventionally
regarded as avant-garde, attending the Cambridge Poetry Festival 1977.
There are some manifestoes (including one for Dataism), and poems by
Kelly and Paul Brown.

Abs: The magazine Tony Frazer set up after *Imprint*. From his editorial
statement at poetrymagazines.org.uk: “If the journal has a ruling
aesthetic, it is one informed by international modernism and by the more
radical kinds of poetry that appeared in the USA and the UK in the 1950s
and 1960s.” Featured poets have included David Jaffin, Emmanuel
Hocquard, Marcelin Pleynet, Harry Guest, Peter Dent, Simon Perchik,
Andrew Duncan, Clive Faust, Nathaniel Tarn and Peter Riley. Other poets
who have been appeared in the magazine include Gustaf Sobin, Guy
Birchard, John Levy, Craig Watson, Laurie Duggan, Gael Turnbull,
Christopher Middleton, Kelvin Corcoran, Trevor Joyce, Peter Larkin,
Frances Presley, Tilla Brading, Ian Davidson, Andy Brown, Rupert M.
Loydell, Martin Anderson, Tim Allen and David Miller. Earlier issues
have been digitized and appear on the Poetry Library’s magazines site,
www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/, while more recent ones appear on the
Shearsman site itself.

**747 Slow Dancer** / edited by John Harvey. London, then Nottingham:
Slow Dancer Press, No. 1 (1977)-30 (Summer 1993). ISSN: 0143-1412

\

Profiled in: John Harvey, “Last Chance for a Slow Dance”, *Poetry
London*, reproduced in full at www.mellotone.co.uk

Related Imprint: Slow Dancer Press published many poetry collections,
including work by Simon Armitage, Lee Harwood, Libby Houston and James
Schuyler

Website: www.mellotone.co.uk

\

Abs: From “Last Chance for a Slow Dance”, Harvey records: “From the
first, there was a strong bias towards American poetry, either written
by Americans themselves, or by those of us whose work showed, in some
respects, an American influence. […] Slow Dancer favoured poems whose
language was direct and colloquial, rather than couched in ‘poetic
diction,’ which were narrative rather than purely lyric (and certainly
not epic!) and which eschewed references to Greek deities or ancient
mythologies.” The magazine emerged from a series of workshops held by
John Harvey, Tina Fulker, Alan Brooks, and Annie Gilligan, themselves
influenced by courses held by the Arvon Foundation. Some issues were
given over to specific subjects, e.g. no. 15, American issue,
guest-edited by Alan Brooks; 27, a Sharon Olds issue; 29, a North
American issue, guest-edited by Rhona McAdam. The editor is best known
as the author of the crime novels which feature the Nottingham-based
detective Charlie Resnick.

arts organisation in Dorset, it is notable for selecting poems which are
submitted without the name of the poet on them, to avoid bias. Each
issue is edited by a different team from a specific regional area. Since
1997 each issue features a southern poet with an essay about him or her
and a selection of their poetry. Relaunched in 2003 following the
withdrawal of funding for Word & Action.
