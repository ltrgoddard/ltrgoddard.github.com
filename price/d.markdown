\

Index: UK Little Magazines Project

Profiled in: a note attached to the index produced by the UK Little

Related Imprint: Aggie Weston’s Editions

\

Abs: A statement carried in each issue: “The name of this magazine comes
indirectly from a work by Kurt Schwitters; ‘A Small Home for Seamen’. I
have been told that it was one Agnes Weston who founded the seamen’s
homes in this country and I hope this magazine will likewise provide
some sort of refuge.” A good-looking, even beautiful, magazine, with an
interest in photography, and typically setting out poems with generous
white-space around them. Contributors included: Thomas Meyer, Ian
Hamilton Finlay, Thomas A. Clark, Stuart Mills, Simon Cutts, Trevor
Winkfield, Andrew Crozier, Gael Turnbull, Richard Long, Robert Lax and
others. No. 14 reprints two letters from the East Midlands Art
Association to Stuart Mills, the first setting out the terms of grant
for any successful application, and the second turning Mills’s
application down on the grounds of its luxurious minimalism: “the
selling price was too low for the lavishness of production but unless
the area of print in each publication was increased the public would not
feel inclined to pay any more.”

\

Abs: The first issue consisted of poems by the editors, plus Jim
Stewart, and various illustrations. These were printed on different
colours and sizes of paper, and simply placed in a plastic bag. It was
sold at the Edinburgh Festival in the summer of 1973, in association
with a sound and vision ensemble known to Hampson, called Zoom Cortex.
This loose leaf “bag mag” physical presentation, with a couple more
poets added to the original editorial line up, continued only for no. 2,
the next issue adopting a stapled card cover. The intention was
announced in no. 3 (Spring 1975) to concentrate more on “one area of
contemporary creative practice” and to represent the range of poetry
being written in England. Further contributors to this issue, which
seems to take a significant leap towards the more difficult and the
avant-garde, included Paul Brown, Lee Harwood (poems, and an essay on
“Surrealist Poetry Today”), Ulli McCarthy, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall,
Boudewijn Wegerif, Heathcote Williams and others. No. 4, edited solely
Robert Hampson, included work by Allen Fisher (and an interview with
him), Jeremy Hilton, Bernard Kelly (including his compilation of
quotations from American poets about Open Field poetry), Roy Fisher,
Eric Mottram, Ulli McCarthy, Alan Davies, Mike Dobbie, Richard Miller,
Emanuel Ro, and the three editors. No. 5 (Autumn 1976) edited by Ken
Edwards, focused on prose poetry, contributors including David Miller,
Nicki Jackowska, Opal L. Nations, Ian Robinson, Steve Snider and others.
That issue also marked a change from the mimeograph stencil production
to commercial printing, presumably offset litho. No. 6 (Summer 1977),
edited by Hampson, includes further work by earlier contributors as well
as by Rosmarie Waldrop, Tom Leonard, Robert Lax, Sarah Lawson, James
Sherry, Elaine Randell, and Barry MacSweeney. With No. 7 (Spring 1978),
edited by Hampson and Edwards, a more visually and physically elaborate
issue was produced. This, the “Assemblage Issue”, included the
specially-mounted, blind-embossed booklet *Honour can be bought & sold
like…* [by Tony Ward?], E. E. Vonna-Michell’s poem about glass-paper,
which included two inserted sheets of that material, and many works of
poetry, usually with a strong visual emphasis, e.g. by Peter Finch,
Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, Alaric Sumner, Herbert Burke, Paula
Claire, Jeremy Adler, Bob Cobbing, P. C. Fencott, cris cheek, Lawrence
Upton and other poets published in previous issues. Edwards’s
acquaintance and correspondence with the Language poet James Sherry was
one of the Anglo-American meeting points of respective contemporary
avant-gardes.

Abs: Set up, in the words of the first issue’s editorial, to
“consolidate the work already done by the Association and give notice of
coming projects – whether literary competitions, conferences, courses,
exhibitions or lectures. It will keep members in touch with each other’s
work and advise on many aspects of school magazine production.” Each
issue included a selection of poetry and prose from school magazines,
and essays and other work by much more established poets, critics, and
other writers, often giving a campaigning and intellectual framework to
the project of empowering students through school magazines.
Contributors included Anselm Hollo, Eric Mottram, Herbert Read, Alan
Sillitoe, Robert Penn Warren, Michael Shayer, Gael Turnbull, J. B.
Priestley, Michael Hamburger, Arnold Wesker, and others. Vol. 1 no. 3

which was made into a play by William Tanner, and as the character Sammy
Giffen in Alan Sharp, *The Wind Shifts* (London: Michael Joseph, 1967),

\

Abs: Strong on essays and tributes to British poets, especially though
not exclusively those who emerged just before and during the 1940s, e.g.
John Heath-Stubbs, W. S. Graham and George Barker. Another strength has
been the Irish poets it has published, including Paul Durcan, Seamus
Heaney, Michael Longley, Derek Mahon, Medhb McGuckian, Paul Muldoon,
Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Eithne Strong, Matthew Sweeney, and others.
Linden has often used the device of guest editor to take advantage of
particular expertise. There can be a considerable time lag between
issues, e.g. four years between 23/24 (1998) and 25/26 (2002).

\

Abs: A significant outlet for writers in exile or regarded as
dissidents, especially those exiled from Eastern Europe. Although the
first issue does not mention it, it is probably a continuation of *Pen
in Exile* produced by the same organisation. There were poems, stories
and essays, and often a feature themed by country of origin, e.g.
Estonians, Ukrainian, Bulgarian literature, etc. Texts are in English
and other languages, and not usually parallel text. Contributors
include: Czeslaw Milosz, Aleksis Rannit, George Faludy, Jean
Schlumberger, Marina Tsvetayeva, Boris Pasternak, Vladimir Nabokov, as
well as Vera Brittain (writing in no. 4 about the importance of exiles
to Britain), and others. Elizabeth Jennings contributes a review of a
Lithuanian anthology in no. 6. Stephen Spender and Nicholas Nabokov
contribute a libretto in no. 15, and T. S. Eliot “A Note on Translation”

in many of the arts and with a certain philosophical outlook. Essayists

Brook gives an interview on his opposition to the American war in

Milton, Brian Patten, Carlyle Reedy, Adrian Mitchell, Richard Holmes,

Anne Palmer, Elizabeth Dowling, Paul Peter Piech, John Farrington and
John Piper. There were articles on John Cotton’s magazine *Priapus* (to
which *Enigma* was a spiritual successor), Robert Graves and Laura
Riding’s Seizin Press, Nicolas de Stael as a book illustrator, printing
*Fishpaste*, Rilke’s influence on English poetry, and other topics.

Philip Steadman in Cambridge, published *Four Essays on Kinetic Art*, by
Frank Popper, Philip Steadman, Reg Gadney and Stephen Bann.

\

Abs: A magazine interested in literary and other arts theory.
Professionally printed with high design and production values that
matched its impressively intellectual remit. As well as theoretical
articles, the magazine published poems, especially visual and sound
poetry. Contributors included: Roland Barthes on “The Activity of
Structuralism”, Pedro Xisto, William Carlos Williams on Emanuel Romano
(posthumously, but for the first time), Ian Hamilton Finlay, Eugen
Gomringer on “The first years of Concrete Poetry”, Raoul Hausmann on
“Meaning and Technique in Phonic Poetry”, David Chaloner, Simon Cutts
(poems, as well as an essay on “The Aesthetic of Ian Hamilton Finlay”)
and others. Each issue featured extracts from what it considered to be a
“Great Little Magazine”, as well as notes and an index to it. Apart from
*Ray* (London, 1927-28), the featured magazines were almost all
published outside of the British Isles: *Secession, Blues*, *G*,
*Mecano, Ray*, *De Stijl*, *SIC*, *Kulchur* and *LEF*. The latter,
though profiled in issue 10, had its index delayed until the intended
issue 11, an issue which seems never to have appeared. The importance to
contemporary practitioners of visual and sound poetry of placing and
asserting their work within a documented historical context, also
demonstrated in magazines such as *Kroklok*, is perhaps no better
illustrated than in *Form*.

**178 Fuse** / edited by David Templer, David Thomas and Paul Johnstone.
Cambridge: [Fuse], No. 1 (June 1972)-4 (Nov. 1973)

\

Abs: “FUSE came into being as a result of a feeling that confrontation
should evolve in the context of communication. We feel that Cambridge
needs a magazine which presents the work of undergraduates beside that
of graduates and senior members, while at the same time placing
University work in a wider perspective. It is important not to see such
work in terms of divisions of any kind; although FUSE is primarily
concerned with literature, we want to set up a focus for a wide range of
creative thought, and to provide the charge for a response.” – the
editorial in no. 1. Contributors included Ian Crichton Smith, Stephen
Poliakoff (short fiction), R. S. Thomas, Peter Levi, John Harvey,
Veronica Forrest-Thomson, J. H. Prynne, Charles Tomlinson, Philip
Hobsbaum, John Mole, John Wilkinson, George Steiner, Jane Rogers, Jon

**180 Gaga** / edited by Paul Brown. London: Gaga Bureau, Issue 1
[1969]-4 (1970)

\

Note: Issue 3 came with a large poster, depicting President Kennedy,
which was used, somewhat obliquely, to advertise the Unicorn Bookshop,
Brighton. Issue 4 bore the cover title *Purple Ga*, and was indeed
purple.

\

Abs: A hippy, psychedelic atmosphere to this magazine. The first issue
has an eighteen-point declaration by the “Bureau of Surreal Activities”
– eg. “9. There are no Virgin Marys… 10. We are the factors determining
the velocity of angels…13. In Britain there are no demilitarised zones…”
Contents included poems, comic strip art, advice on what to do if
arrested, listings of other little magazines, and collages. Despite
*Gaga* stating leftist aspirations, pictures of near-naked women appear
in ways that seem untroubled by their objectification; a collage
announcing “smash the bourgeoisie” uses photos of what appear to be
several Chinese civilians and one Chinese soldier. Poets included
Lawrence Upton, Libby Houston, Helen Fletcher, Peter Finch, Julian
Elliot, the editor and others.

Abs: Beginning as much as a magazine of counterculture as a literary
magazine, *Global Tapestry* was against the Vietnam War and for general
peaceful revolution, love and veganism, and it published the manifesto
of the Love & Peace Freak Party in the second issue. Work by Kenneth
Patchen was published in its pages, and Patchen seems to have been a key
figure for the magazine in the early years; it was soon published more
poetry, with work from the editors, Jim Burns, Andrew Darlington, David
Tipton, Vivienne Finch, Steve Sneyd, Michael Horovitz, and many others.
After a few years, Dave Cunliffe edited the magazine alone. It was
produced in mimegraph format until 1991, when it closed for nearly ten
years, re-launching with what looks like desk-top camera-ready copy in
2000, with issue no. 22.

Abs: Contributors included Pete Brown, Mal Dean and Libby Houston,
described as “now working on a series of ‘goings-on’ (free experiments
in jazz, poetry, drama, etc.) at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill
Gate.” Two of the contributors seem to have been work acquaintances of
Lee Harwood, then employed as a packer, including Mal Dean, and Geoffrey
Hazzard. Byrne and Jones were interested in and wrote science fiction;
another contributor, Paul Pignon, was described as a “poet, jazz
musician, composer, & ex-atomic physicist.” This was clearly a magazine
about cross-over and experimentation; now better-known poets also
appeared in its pages, including Harry Guest, Spike Hawkins, Anselm
Hollo and Penelope Shuttle. A second issue was advertised on the last
page of the first issue, to be guest-edited by Anselm Hollo, but seems
not to have materialised.

\

Profiled in: Tom Clyde, *Irish Literary Magazines: an outline history
and descriptive bibliography* (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2003), BL:
2725.g.3414

\

Abs: Related to *Ego* and *Both Sides Now*, this magazine’s expressed
aim was to “enlight and ignite you […and to establish] a small,
independent press.” It published anti Vietnam War political cartoons,
comic strips, sound and visual poetry, more conventional poems, a song
(with sheet music), an interview with an Irishman sent to a mental
hospital in Epsom after being unable to pay a bill at a well-known venue
in London, an account of someone being imprisoned for nine years for
possession of a very small amount of marijuana, short fiction, an
article on the evolution of rock music, and a brief attack on Irish
Prime Minister Jack Lynch following the British Army killings on “Bloody
Sunday”. Issue two reveals an acknowledged affinity with the London Arts
Lab: Hooley had tried to establish an equivalent centre in Belfast, but
had been thwarted by the police. By issue three it described its
circulation as 2000, and explained that it was part of the Queen’s
University student scene without being formally connected to it.
Overall, there is a gentle sense of humour to this counter-culture
magazine but nevertheless a determination to avoid and challenge
political and religious divisions in Belfast and Northern Ireland.
Judging from the high proportion of pages given over to poems, poetry
was central to it. Contributors included Steve Sneyd, Denis Greig,
George Cairncross, Claire Winston, Robert Johnstone, George Dowden, and
others.

Historical figures’ work was included and presented beautifully (George
Herbert, Kurt Schwitters, Apollinaire) and contemporary work and some
comment by Ian Hamilton Finlay, Anselm Hollo, Henri Chopin, John
Furnival, Houédard, Eugene Gomringer and others. Issue no. 3 also had a
feature by Robinson (who worked in Wimbledon's Dept. of Painting), this

Abs: From the last issue: “LITTACK is ceasing because it is undeniable
that it has made its fundamental point – namely, it has asserted – and
re-iterated over a period of time – the constant need for a tensional
base for poetry, a polemical climate for the, often violent, exchange of
ideas about the craft. But, as LITTACK has striven to emphasise, such
‘exchange’ cannot confine itself, any more than poetry can, to a
discussion of technicalities. It is easy, in retrospect, to see the
damage that has been done by the modernist’s obsession with technique –
the direct cause of such present-day absurd notions as ‘the poem’s
proper subject is language itself’. Of course, this is false – a poem’s
proper subject is life, words but forming an artifact for the expression
of the subject. Equally absurd has been the imposed fiction, traceable
to Pound, that all attempted expression be limited or restricted to the
object. […] It was out of such a realization that LITTACK created a
polemical forum to allow discussion and controversy, to permit the
pubication of various manifestos, to offer a philosophy of poetry
(neo-vitalism) and, above all, to make the point that life must be let
into poetry all the time.” Contributors included: Kathleen Raine, Hugo
Manning, Tom Scott, Hugh MacDiarmid, Martin Booth, Stephen Wade, Ian
Hamilton Finlay, and others. Peter Russell acted as Overseas Editor.

\

Abs: The title is taken from the village in Wales whose the railway
station has the longest name of any in Britain, and perhaps the world.
Because of its length, library catalogues sometimes replace the title
with the abbreviation *Llanfair P.G*. Contributors to this generally
one-sheet per issue, largely French language magazine included Claude
Royet-Journoud, Claude Faïn, Joseph Guglielmi, Lars Fredrikson, Roger
Laporte, Rosmarie Waldrop (a poem printed so that it could only be read
faintly through the other side of the page), Edmond Jabès, Anthony
Barnett, Roger Giroux, Jean Daive, Keith Waldrop, Hoy himself and
others. There was a strong visual element to many of the texts, using
drawn lines, handwriting, and the whole whitespace of the page.

\

Abs: Contributors include Allen Ginsberg, Ted Berrigan, Ron Padgett,
Gerard Malanga, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and others. Ginsberg declined
payment for his poem “Ankor Wat” and his money was divided among the
other contributors. There was more of a news element to the second issue
of the magazine, for example the drug experimentalist Timothy Leary’s
arrest was reported, as was the founding of the London Free School, and
there were pieces by Tom Wolfe and Harry Fainlight. *Long Hair* can be
regarded as a precursor of the underground press, outside the scope of
this bibliography, such as *International Times* (BL: Newspaper

nearly thirty years, between no. 28, in 1969, and no. 29, in 1998. Also
involved editorially: Elizabeth Harvey, Graziella Sara Cacace, Alison
Cameron and Hilary Sheers.

**278 Medley** / edited by Douglas Priestley. Potters Bar: Douglas

\

Abs: An early backlash against mimeographed magazines: the idea, as
stated in the first editorial, was to produce a magazine *not* printed
by typewritten stencil and duplicator. Instead it was “to introduce
poets to people who matter, because it will present their work in normal
book style.” Contributors included many who remain obscure, but also
(presumably) Penelope Shuttle (writing as P. D. Shuttle), and D.M.
Black.

Abs: Size A5, stencil-printed: mostly short stories and *Reader’s
Digest*-like talking-point articles (“Pity the dumb animal”; “Is an
intelligent machine possible?”; “The evils of black magic”), but with
poems interspersed. An open letter issued after the final number reveals
that the magazine had been printed on a Roneo 250 Duplicator. In trying
to trade up to a Gestetner 300 , a part-exchange deal had gone wrong and
only a Roneo 450 had been delivered. Because of difficulties with the
new Roneo, the editor explains, the magazine has had to close.

**332 Other Times** / edited by Mr. E. (Fiction, Portfolio), Paul Brown
(Faction, Poetry & Film), and Andrew Brown (Music, Letters, Cartoons).
London: P.P. Layouts, Vol. 1 no. 1 (Nov.1975-Jan. 1976)

\

Abs: “Other Times is an international *speculative* quarterly. Sad as
this thin word seems, it at least defines our vices. Like Jean Harlow in
McClure’s ‘The Beard’ we have to say to you, “Before you can pry any
secrets from me, you must first find the real me! Which one will you
pursue?” We offer you in every issue some tactics, some strategy, some
method of inquiry. We offer you in every issue new destinations, some
diversions, some dead-ends. Which one you pursue is a matter of
beautiful indifference to us. We shall continue to massage the organs of
this media before your very eyes. We intend that something should happen
between your ears rather than the lobotomy others seek to engineer.” –
from the editorial, signed by “The Editors”. The magazine has fairly
high production values for its time, using black and white visuals
creatively and with a black, blue and white glossy cover. As the
editorial suggests it is characterised by eclecticism and it looks both
to America and the Continent, with not a little nod to Surrealism. Items
include a cartoon strip, short fiction, Eric Mottram on “Dionysus in
America”, and essay on the film-maker Georges Mélièse, and poems by
Blaise Cendrars translated by Peter Hoida. The name of the publisher,
P.P. Layouts, is a jokey reference to the sinister corporation in Philip
K. Dick’s novel *The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch*. Perhaps the
editor’s name, “Mr. E.”, is also an in-joke of this kind.

Abs: Stout hardback format; poetry and essays. The first editorial
suggests a seeking of consensus for British poetry on the basis of “the
necessary intelligence that must be brought to the poetic act (whether
of writing or reading), the shaping of adequate forms, and, equally
important, the responsibilities to a viatal linguistic and formal
heritage, to a living language, to a living community.” Contributors
included: Kingsley Amis, James Atlas, Ted Hughes, Michael Longley,
Elizabeth Jennings, Michael Hamburger, Elaine Feinstein, Terry Eagleton,
Roy Fuller, Douglas Dunn, W. S. Graham, Donald Davie, Val Warner, Peter
Scupham, C. H. Sisson, Peter Porter, Stewart Conn, James Aitchison,
Christopher Middleton, Tom Paulin and others. Important for its in-depth
essays, which remain a significant part of its successor, *P.N. Review*.

Abs: An extraordinarily international poetry magazine, including work
from Brazil, Russia, Cuba, the United States, France, England and
Scotland: at turns interested in sound, visual, futurist, objectivist,
concrete and minimalist poetry, not to mention art and photography; and,
as with almost all Finlay productions, executed with style and a light
touch. The first issue was edited by “J. McGuffie and P. Pond”, and
subsequent issues anonymously, but it is assumed that Finlay was the
main editor. There appear to have been two different versions of no. 2,
both of which are held by the National Library of Scotland. As well as
Finlay himself, contributors include George Mackay Brown, Robert
Garioch, Douglas Young, Tom McGrath, Helen Cruickshank, Edwin Morgan,
Crombie Saunders, J. F. Hendry, D. M. Black, Mayakovsky, Attila József,
Robert Lax, Ronald Johnson and Edgard Braga, as well as the artists Ad
Reinhardt, Charles Biederman, Bridget Riley, John Furnival and Emil

\

Abs: “PRIAPUS, a magazine of poetry and art, was begun in 1962 by John
Cotton and Ted Walker, who were working at that time in Southall at the
Grammar Technical School. […] In its time PRIAPUS printed the first
published poems of its two founders and the first or early poems of D.
M. Thomas, Miles Burrows, Gerda Mayer, Norman Jackson, Sally Purcell,
Peter Jay, Paul Coltman, Peter Cundall, John Mole, Peter Scupham, Wes
Magee, W. G. Shepherd, Christopher Pilling, Roger Iredale and others now
well known in their own right. […] Covers were designed and printed by
Oscar Mellor at his Fantasy Press and by Alan Tarling at the Poet and
Printer Press, and art work was supplied by Oscar Mellor, Michael
Markham, Heinke Jenkins and Jack Yates amongst others. Then with PRIAPUS
9, in the Summer of 1967, Rigby Graham joined forces with us and the art
began to rival the poetry as our reason for existence.” - John Cotton,

London: No. 1 (1970)-7? (1974?)

\

Abs: Halfway between a magazine and a pamphlet series, each issue with
its own title. After the first two issues, which had a selection of
different authors, no. 1 titled *Tramps*, no. 2 *Zusammen*, issues
tended to be given over to a single author’s work, e.g. no. 3 was
McCarthy’s *Erire*, with drawings by Nuttall.

as Roy Fisher*,* *Ten Interiors with Various Figures* (1966), BL:
YA.1987.a.9983. It also published the more substantial magazine
*Tarasque*.

\

Abs: Many of these one-sheet issues took the form of instructions and
exercises, adopting the tone of the first issue which declared,
“Assuming from the onset that the reader has little or no grounding in
literature we will commence and continue in a very direct manner.” This
was matched by the design of the masthead which featured a red L sign
for Learner. The intention seems to have been to encourage poets to read
more poetry and to read more critically. By issue four, the lessons on
Hopkins and Logue etc. had been replaced by a sole photograph of some
rocks; issue five was a poem by Edwin Morgan about “Making a Poem”;
later numbers had texts by Stephen Bann, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Simon
Cutts and Stuart Mills. Edited anonymously, from the Trent Book Shop.

number of special issues, e.g., on Eliot (no. 4, Nov. 1962), on William
Empson (No. 6/7, June 1963), on the Black Mountain poets (no. 10, Summer
1964), and the last issue published the contributions of many poets on
the theme, “The State of Poetry - A Symposium”. Some issues were part of
a Pamphlet Series, e.g. no. 13 comprises Antonio Machado, *The Garden in
the Evening*, tr. Colin Falck. Also involved editorially: Colin Falck,

Contributors include C. L. R. James, Mervyn Morris, Aimé Cesaire, Derek
Walcott, James Berry, John Figueroa, Linton Kwesi Johnson, E. A.
Markham, Judy Miles, Stuart Hall, V. S. Naipaul, and others. The

\

Note: Title varies with each issue, e.g. French Schmuck, General
Schmuck, Teutonic Schmuck, Aktual Schmuck Czechoslovakia, Schmuck
Iceland, Hungarian Schmuck, Japanese Schmuck. Some issues appear to have
formed part of a wider monographic series “Schmuck anthological”.

\

Abs: A note on the website of the Department of Special Collections and
University Archives, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford,
California, where a Beau Geste Press archive is held, summarises the
project: “The Beau Geste Press existed in England between 1971-1974. It
was founded by Felipe Ehrenberg, David Mayor, Chris Welch, and Martha
Hellion. It printed the works of visual poets, conceptualists, and
neo-dadaists, many of whom were closely tied to the Fluxus movement. The
press printed artist books using inexpensive materials, such as
mimeograph machines, cheap paper, and staples. In 1974 the Beau Geste
Press merged with several similar presses to form BAAA, the Beau and
Aloes Arc Association.” *Schmuck* itself seems to have been a project to
collect avant-garde poems and other short texts, especially visual and
paper-engineered work from the particular country named in the title.
The primary Beau Geste archive is held in the archives of Tate Britain,
London.

Abs: “Scotland 1968. Mainly urban population, sharing with the rest of
Britain a Government, mass media, and much of the available Press and
publishing - among other things. There is discontent with the
consequences of this situation for Scotland. As witness Hamilton and
other SNP successes. One must neither underrate nor exaggerate what this
unease means. The shared interests and culture form part of the terms
within which people are now living in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
Dundee and other places. It is with these people, defined in these
terms, that our story begins.” - from the first editorial. Open to all
the issues and arts in Scotland and with a very strong poetry presence.

Scotland*, these annual volumes published an eclectic mix of Scottish
poetry. Most of the significant Scottish poets of the time appeared
within its pages. The little hardbacks in the Edinburgh University Press
phase are particularly attractive and pleasing to hold.

Issue 21 ran to 268 in B-format with a circulation of 2,500. It was
*the* British poetry magazine of the period featuring most UK writers
and leavened with Americans and with Europeans in translation. The
magazine had a strong leaning towards the innovative and regularly
included concrete and experimental works in its pages. A great strength
was *The Small Press Scene*, a vast and comprehensive round-up of
activity among poetry and alternative publishers world-wide.” - From

\

Related Work: Michael Kane, *Works, 1985-2001* (London: Artspace

interviewed by Marianne O’Kane

\

Abs: The long opening editorial in the first issue draws on Cézanne,
Léger, Jack and W. B. Yeats, and especially Anthony Cronin. The magazine
is characterised by fairly long essays on all the arts, including
architecture, and plenty of space is given to generally figurative
artwork, some of the latter by the editor, an artist. This is an urban,
modernist magazine which, taking its cue from Anthony Cronin’s suspicion
of the use of pastoral in Irish writing, pitted itself against what it
called “Bogolatory”.

Related Work: *Wallpaper*. *Audio Arts Supplement* No. 1 (1975). British
Library Sound Archive shelfmark: 1CA0012461. A cassette of sound

\

Abs: Experimental magazine, presenting half a dozen or so sequences of
poetry and other texts and visuals in each issue. The first number was
edited anonymously, after which the contributors were described as the
“contributing editors” to each issue. It was an A4 stapled, mimeographed
publication with a wrap-around cover consisting of a sheet of wallpaper.
Despite the mimeo format, the range of visuals and other formal elements
suggests a sophisticated and steady art direction to the magazine, and
the poetry reflects this cerebral, avant-garde approach. An interest in
the permutational suggests affinities at least with Oulipo, but, as the
*Wallpaper* cassette makes explicit, there is also an interest in sound
and performance. Contributors came from the world of poetry, drama,
music, visual art, sculpture, and sociology, and included: Richard
Quarrell, Amikam Toren, David Coxhead, Anthony Howell, John Welch,
Anthony McCall, Andrew Eden, Richard Bernas, Susan Hiller, Bill
Shepherd, Susan Bonvin and others.

\

Abs: “This issue of the *Women’s Liberation Review* grew out of a
workshop on Women and Literature at the Women’s Liberation Conference in
Manchester (March, 1972). Most of us were women writing in the isolation
of our own homes who wanted to share our experiences, communicate our
ideas. All of us were women who felt the need for our movement to
generate its own body of literature in response to our situation. A
Women’s Literature Collective which would work together to create an
anthology of women’s writings seemed to answer both these needs.” – from
the anonymous editorial in the first issue. Poems, political essays and
literary criticism, illustrations, photographs, and personal testimony.
