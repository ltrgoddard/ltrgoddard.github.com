I'm a journalist and programmer. I currently work as a Senior Data Investigations Advisor at the campaign group Global Witness, where I do data-driven investigations on stuff like [tax avoidance](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oleg-tinkov-isle-of-man/), [money laundering](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/btc-e-vinnik-mayzus/), [deforestation](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/beef-banks-and-brazilian-amazon/), [social media manipulation](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/drc-smear-campaign/), [digital privacy](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/digital-threats/covid-19-tracing-apps-must-not-interfere-human-rights/) and the [oil and gas industry](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/eu-green-deal-politicians/). I'm also a consultant to the [Anti-Corruption Data Collective](https://acdatacollective.org/).

I finished a [PhD in contemporary poetry](https://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/68758/) at the University of Sussex in 2016 then spent two and a half years as a data journalist at *The Times*, where I worked on [more than a dozen](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Athetimes.co.uk+louis+goddard) front-page stories, including flagship investigations into [cyber-crime](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-hackers-trade-british-ministers-email-addresses-and-passwords-hqtr7pv9z), [tax havens](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-third-of-british-billionaires-have-moved-to-a-tax-haven-zk6q53rtd) and [government contracting](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gagging-clauses-criticism-of-theresa-may-banned-in-grenfell-safety-deal-7mbdll6cj).

I've spoken about my work at conferences in the US, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the UK, generally focussing on my research into [dark net markets](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dark-net-dealers-dragged-into-the-light-kx05bc3jd) and [child abuse forums](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/child-abuse-network-had-10-000-uk-members-d665p2nwk). My main technical tools are [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@ltrgoddard/) and PostgreSQLâ€”I also do a lot of R and Python.
