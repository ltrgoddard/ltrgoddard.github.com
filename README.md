# Notes

Before connecting the *PTM* more directly to the work of Oliver and Lewis, it is worth considering the academic aspect of the text in more detail. As noted above, the conference frame is incidental to the thesis that sits at the heart of the text, but it is not therefore arbitrary. Prynne has spent almost his entire literary career in an academic environment---an environment towards which he has entertained considerable ambivalence, as the latter part of Chapter 1 sought to demonstrate. The university and its associated institutions constitute the field of production of virtually all of Prynne's poetry and prose. Why, then, does it take until 1974 for this field to become visible in the work itself? To put it another way, what is it about the precise period in which the *PTM* was composed that allows the academy to cross the gap from context to content? It appears easy to dismiss this question by referring to the *PTM*'s origins in the satirical newspaper *Bean News*, in which Prynne's character Erasmus W. Darwin had already been established as a scholar, if not strictly as an academic.^[Darwin uses a consistently technical vocabulary in his regular 'bulletins', and in 'When is now' appears to have access to data from the fictional 'Cambridge-based Bioparallax Research Station' (*Bean News* \[1972\], \[p. 4\]).] Yet all this really serves to do is to the push the question back a couple of years, from the time of the publication of the *PTM* as such in 1974 to the beginning of Prynne's reports for *Bean News* in 1972. An answer seems unlikely to be found at the macro level of UK higher education policy, either: in stark contrast to her period as Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher's 1970-74 tenure as Education Secretary saw British universities remained comparatively unmolested---her written statement at the launch of the 1972 Education White Paper spent more space on teacher training than on the entirety of higher education.^[Margaret Thatcher, 'Written Statement launching Education White Paper (*A Framework for Expansion*)' (6 December 1972), *Margaret Thatcher Foundation*, \<http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/102233\> \[accessed 7 September 2015\].] What, then, of the micro level, that of Prynne's individual career? In 1972, Prynne became a University Lecturer, having previously only held positions at his own college, Gonville and Caius; writing to Dorn, he emphasised that the role came with 'something close to tenure if I want it'.^[Prynne to Dorn, 10 January 1972, Box 44, Folder 657, Edward Dorn Papers.] As might be expected, this appointment seems to have entailed a considerable increase in his professional responsibilities. Writing to Dorn again in 1975, in a notably untidy hand, Prynne gives a vague but powerful account of the stresses of combining academic work with childcare:

> for the last 50 hours I've had no sleep at all. I don't know how I got into this stupid spiral and I must never do it again. But until this bloody term is over I can do +nothing+ [...]. When+ever+ you ring I am working with some eager creep, when I finish it's never before 4 a.m., it's a treadmill [...].^[Prynne to Dorn, 5 March 1975, Box 20, Folder 335, Edward Dorn Papers. Married with two young children and having recently bought a house, it is perhaps not so difficult to see why Prynne would in his mid- to late-30s emphasise maturity as an aesthetic criterion. ]

What is it, then, that links the *PTM* to the work of Oliver and Lewis, its 'Mortmerian' character having already been considered? The key point of connection, which gives rise to a number of subconnections, is the text's concern with the body. It was argued above that both Lewis and Oliver strive continually to defamiliarize the human body; this is done primarily through the means of metaphor (Lewis's 'creaking men-machines', Oliver's ice cream cornets and penknives), with the body as tenor and some conventionally inanimate object as vehicle. Beyond defamiliarization, the fundamental effect here is to remove the barrier between the body and its other: the body becomes a simple part of the material world, just like anything else. At times, however, this metaphorical structure breaks down into something less rigid. This can be seen clearly in the second quotation from Oliver given above, in which the body is said to resemble 'three rams' heads on a totem-pole'. While this introduction obeys the conventional arrangement of tenor and vehicle, what follows does not, as the body is divided into three faces, comprising the character's actual face, his torso and his genitals. Comparing a face to a face is relatively straightforward, but doing the same with a face and a torso or a face and genitals---separate parts of the same body---is more complex. As a metaphorical operation, it may be considered the reverse of that for which Prynne defended Shelley in his reply to Leavis, though it is by no means less disruptive of conventional sense-making. Rather than forgetting the tenor in a too-eager concern for the properties of the metaphorical vehicle, Oliver sticks rigidly to the former, seeking his vehicle in the tenor itself. This is achieved through successive metonymic expansions (from the torso and genitals to the body as a whole) and contractions (from the body back down to the face). In the case of the torso-face comparison, this operation works along a pre-existing aesthetic path laid down by such works as the paintings in René Magritte's *Le Viol* ('The Rape') series.^[Another Magritte painting, *La Durée poignardée* ('Time Transfixed'), is used on the cover of the 1972 Penguin edition of Upward's *The Railway Accident*.]

The metaphorical implications of the *PTM* with regard to the human body similarly fail to conform to the simple animate/inanimate defamiliarization structure. In Prynne's text, plants take the place of humans, but this is by no means a simple process of substitution. In fact, the *PTM* derives much of its comic force precisely from its own failure to seamlessly map tenor on to vehicle, leaving the reader in a sort of no-man's-land between the two. As mentioned above, the most important clue to the text's metaphorical structure is provided by the characters' names: Lichen, Cypress, 'Myrtle' Gale. Yet Prynne allows the reader to take in four lengthy paragraphs of Professor Quondam Lichen's reported paper before his colleague, Cypress, is introduced, making it difficult to pick up on the joke from the very beginning. Moreover, the use of a mixed bag of species (Gale, referring to *Myrica gale*), plant family (Cypress) and organism (Lichen) names in place of personal names creates further confusion: are these characters to be understood as individual plants, or as representatives of their hierarchically distinct botanical categories? Is it significant that the character with the highest academic honours, Lichen, represents the most conceptually broad category, or that the only character definitely identified as a woman represents the narrowest? What is the significance of sexual identification at all---including, in lines such as 'Dr G flashed a sweet smile', what seems like flirting---in relation to organisims which are only rarely dioecious (having separate male and female plants)?^[*PTM*, p. 238.] On a more troubling level, if the characters are to be understood as plants, then are they experimenting on their own kind? or is, for example, Lichen's work on beans intended to mirror human experimentation on other mammals? Is the apparent lack of a clear hierarchical relationship between scientist and subject, lichen and beans, cause for concern, or does it in fact give the lie to human prejudices based on evolutionary complexity?^[The issue of prejudice is of course taken up in the seminar scene, in which Lichen claims that 'there are all too many today who confuse height above ground with innate developmental superiority' (*Ibid.*, p. 236).] To ask such questions is not to 'over-read' an essentially comic text, but rather to treat the *PTM*'s fictional frame with the same seriousness that critics have used in analysing its scientific content.

To understand whether or not the characters in the *PTM* have bodies in a conventional sense, it is appropriate to turn once again to the seminar scene discussed above. Beginning at the conclusion of Lichen's paper, this scene includes the first significant use of verbs to describe characters' actions, the only previous instance being the statement in the introductory paragraph that the paper was 'delivered by Professor Quondam Lichen'.^[*Ibid.*, p. 234.] The paper having been delivered, then, Lichen is greeted with 'polite, photosynthetic applause.'^[*Ibid.*, p. 235.] Immediately, plant (photosynthesis) and human (applause) are confused, with no guidance given on how to interpret the resulting compound, though the mention of photosynthesis perhaps suggests plants clapping their leaves. The narrator makes reference to a 'prolonged lunch' preceding the seminar, but the characters are never described eating and drinking directly, leaving the exact nature of their physical embodiment mysterious. In the course of Lichen's drunken rant, the pendulum seems to swing from human back to plant action; defending the status of lichens as a class, the professor describes 'seeing trees *held up* by their Lichen canopies', a statement in which the capitalisation of 'lichen' reintroduces the problems of naming which have already been described.^[*Ibid.*, p. 236.] Dismissing carrots, he further alleges that 'those crowlin' creatures will metabolise anything, phagocytic riff-raff', a statement which obviously takes its points of reference from the plant kingdom, despite humans also being able to 'metabolise'.^[*Ibid.*] Finally, Lichen's collapse after having 'taken in a good deal of liquid refreshment' is clearly meant to recall alcoholic intoxication, yet the lack of an explicit statement to that effect leaves open the possibility of a more plant-appropriate explanation.^[*Ibid.*, p. 237.]

In the course of the *PTM*'s narrative sections, Prynne is clearly concerned to blur the boundary between human and plant, refusing to provide a one-to-one correspondence (if such a thing would even be possible) between the actions of his characters and what they represent. He does not simply 'see men as trees, walking' (Mark 8:24): the plants in Prynne's text think, act and speak like humans, yet what they speak about---phagocytosis, photosynthesis---often reaffirms their status as non-human organisms. The 'tensions underlying this London conference' might, then, be glossed as the natural conflicts which emerge from any attempt to adopt an attitude of scientific observation towards life. It is notable that Lichen's seemingly well-intentioned defence of the 'lowly organisms' against Cypress's use of the term 'higher plants' quickly descends into a new form of name-calling; following the attack on carrots, he comes out with the ambiguously patrician/meritocratic statement that 'any natural fool would make a clever fellow, if he was properly brought up', before revealing another prejudice: 'though for them worm-infested tubers it's mostly *down*, unsaturated carbon chains of the most naive kind'.^[*Ibid.*, p. 236-37. SIGNIFICANCE OF LINNAEUS REFERENCE?] If, having followed his argument so far, we bridle at Lichen's denigration of tubers, why should we retain a similarly arbitrary prejudice placing humans in ethical superiority to plants? In this sense, the *PTM* uses the metaphorical techniques of literary fiction---techniques similar to those used by Oliver---temporarily to tap into a wider constellation of early-'70s concerns, characterised by the emerging environmental movement in general and the controversy around plant sentience in particular.^[Key environmentalist milestones in this period include the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, the US ban on the pesticide DDT in 1972 and the founding of the first national green party, Britain's PEOPLE, in 1973.]

This controversy is epitomised by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird's *The Secret Life of Plants* (1973), which appeared in the year between Prynne's contributions to *Bean News* and the publication of the compiled *PTM*, though excerpts had been included in the November 1972 issue of *Harper's Magazine*.^[Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, 'Love among the cabbages', *Harper's Magazine* (November 1972), pp. 90-92, 94-96.] In this engagingly written but academically questionable work, the authors summarise the alleged findings of a number of independent researchers into plant intelligence, going on to discuss the implications of these findings for humanity's interaction with the plant world. Both the researchers quoted and the authors themselves make frequent use of concepts and terminology associated with the New Age movement and other 'alternative philosophies', and Tompkins and Bird take a stance deliberately biased in favour of their subject, though not without the occasional hint of irony. Discussing the work of Clive Backster, for example---a CIA interrogation specialist who used polygraph machines to claim that plants could anticipate human actions---the authors describe how

> plants can quickly become so attuned to human beings that it is not always possible to obtain exactly the same reactions with different experimenters. […] Personal involvement with an experiment, and even prior knowledge of the exact time an event was scheduled, was often enough to 'tip off' a plant into noncooperation.^[Tompkins and Bird, *The Secret Life of Plants* (New York: Harper & Row, 1973), p. 12.]

More interesting than the specific experimental results, or lack thereof, is the general tenor of the book, which in its combination of playful openmindedness and (nominally) scientific method mirrors Prynne's approach in the *PTM*. It is particularly telling that in the book's introduction Tompkins and Bird raise the exact phenomenon which forms the factual basis for Prynne's plant time hypothesis:

> Poets and philosophers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Rudolf Steiner, who took the trouble to watch plants, discovered that they grow in opposite directions, partly burrowing into the ground as if attracted by gravity, partly shooting up into the air as if pulled by some form of antigravity, or levity.^[*Ibid.*, p. x.]

For all Katko's emphasis on the absolute seriousness of the *PTM*, a tension between 'gravity' (the scientific hypothesis) and 'levity' (the comic fictional frame) makes for an apt description of the text itself.

That Prynne, like Oliver, is aware of the specific power wielded by partial or ambiguous metaphors---the comparison between plants and humans in the *PTM* being a paradigmatic example---can be seen by turning to a recent prose work, *Graft and Corruption: Shakespeare's Sonnet 15* (2015), which also happens to deal with the plant kingdom. Despite fitting into the sequence of Prynne's post-2001 commentaries on Shakespeare, Wordsworth and George Herbert---a category which arguably also includes 2014's *Concepts and Conception in Poetry*, a study of Wordsworth and Wallace Stevens---*Graft and Corruption* has origins closer to the period of this thesis, though not strictly within it: according to a note on the text, '[t]his lecture, originally given in the Faculty of English at Cambridge University in around the late 1970s-early 1980s, has been more recently (2015) somewhat extended, though its main arguments have not been altered and its references have not been updated.'^[Prynne, *Graft and Corruption: Shakespeare's Sonnet 15* (Cambridge: Face Press, 2015), p. 52. The latest book cited in the text is Roy Strong's *The Renaissance Garden in England* (1979), which Prynne describes as 'recent'.] Here, Prynne offers an exemplary technical reading of Shakespeare's poem, drawing on extensive research into the early modern understanding of horticultural grafting---the artifical attachment of a fresh shoot or 'scion' from one plant to the 'stock' of another---to provide a new interpretation of the sonnet's final two lines, 'And all in war with Time for loue of you | As he takes from you, I ingraft you new.'^[William Shakespeare, *Shake-speares Sonnets Neuer before Imprinted* (London, 1609), sig. B~4~^r^, quoted in *Ibid.* , p. 12.] Beginning with a discussion of the soul, Prynne notes that 'the apparently generalising usage of "thing" in line one ['When I consider euery thing that growes'] disguis[es] the decisive recognition that, while men and plants are alike technically *things that grow*, the difference is that man's soul traditionally does not grow but is the immortal part immune to physical time.'^[*Ibid.*, p. 14.] The grafting operation desired by Shakespeare's speaker is therefore aberrant from a conventional Christian perspective, seeking to prolong the life of the body rather than that of the soul. The technicalities of grafting as a process further destabilize the metaphor. As Prynne points out,

> the action of grafting requires three components: the stock or basal part of a plant; the scion or shoot from another and preferred species; and the grafter. The last two need give little trouble, since the grafter is the poet-lover and the scion is the image of the beloved in his youthful beauty and perfection. But what is the stock?^[*Ibid.*, p. 39.]

Prynne's candidate is the poem itself, or the sequence of poems which makes up the *Sonnets*. Yet this possibility introduces a tension to the extent that a grafting stock has no independent life of its own---once the grafting process is complete, the scion determines almost all future activity. Either the poet's creations are merely supporting structures for their images of the beloved, or the beloved himself is the stock supporting the growth of the poems, a possibility which seems almost sacrilegious in the broader context of the Renaissance sonnet sequence and its ideological underpinnings. Prynne concludes with the suggestion that the flawed and self-contradictory nature of the grafting analogy---earlier, he refuses to describe it as an 'image', 'since the metaphoric device cannot be envisaged in any way literally or as intelligible to the mind's eye'---might be part of a deliberate strategy of self-sabotage, causing the structure of the poem to fail at its apex in order to reveal something more profound about the nature of desire and its (non)fulfillment.^[*Ibid.*, pp. 38-39.] Is it possible, he asks, 'that the image will not work quite seriously enough to be taken seriously; and deliberately thus, as to take it with full seriousness would be to discover that it could not work at all?'^[*Ibid.*, p. 49.]

How, then, does Prynne's argument in *Graft and Corruption* relate to the subjects which were identified at the beginning of this section, principally sexual maturity and the body? It will be recalled that Prynne uses youth and maturity as oppositional terms in his discussion of writers such as Lewis and Oliver, painting American poets as 'art-gallery nympholepts' concerned only with a 'pre-sexual phenomenology' that is essentially, and unfortunately, French. This national coding ties into a broader structure counterposing solid, serious work and frivolous artificiality, which can be detected as the basis of many comments in Prynne's letters in this period; writing to the American poet Robin Blaser in 1973, for instance, with a stinging critique of his work, Prynne refers to 'the fashionable French intellectual, more than content with the sawdust of rhetoric in place of the true honie & gall on the lips of the poet'---a poet who, if the archaic orthography of the proverbial 'honey and gall' is anything to go by, is English by default.^[Prynne to Robin Blaser, 28 August 1973, Box 19, Folder 334, Edward Dorn Papers.] There seems at first glance to be a ready-made counterpart to this structure in the opposition between natural growth and grafting. Natural growth shares all the qualities implicitly promoted by Prynne: it is the product of sexual reproduction among mature plants whose physical proximity ensures a certain level of indigeneity. Grafting, by contrast, involves the eminently artifical importation of 'foreign' shoots (within certain genetic limits) with the explicit purpose of rendering sexual reproduction unnecessary. Thus, while grafted plants are not strictly 'pre-sexual' in the sense that they are unable ultimately to reproduce, what they exhibit is a sort of fast-tracked or counterfeit maturity; moreover, if a process of continual regrafting such as that seemingly described in Sonnet 15 takes place, then they will not even need to sexually reproduce themselves. As if that wasn't enough, Prynne notes that '[i]n earlier literary usage, often allegorical, the characteristic term for scion is *ympe*', a word with a pleasing similarity, if not a directly etymological connection, to *nymph*.^[Prynne, *Graft and Corruption*, p. 31.
