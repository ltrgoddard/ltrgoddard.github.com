# Doctoral student and freelance writer

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Sussex---read my academic [here](cv.html)---and a freelance writer and researcher on education policy. In recent years I've covered [exam boards](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/exam-board-blues-are-universities-the-answer) and [research funding](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/opinion/the-ahrcs-doctoral-training-disasters/2009975.article) for *Times Higher Education*, [GCSE marking](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/05/gcse-exams-tiering-michael-gove) and [appeals](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/09/ofsted-complaint-school-off-inspection-teachers) for *The Guardian* and produced a [report on the postgraduate funding crisis](http://www.if.org.uk/archives/5409/higher-education-a-tale-of-two-payslips) for the Intergenerational Foundation. I used to write on [technology](http://www.theverge.com/users/louisgoddard/posts) for *The Verge* and have also freelanced for the *The Times* and the *TLS*.
