				var id='II\n\nFrom that spot my spirit sprang in space -\nMy body\'s bulk abides. In dreams\nMy ghost has gone, by God\'s grace,\nAdventuring where marvels have been.\nI know no part of this new place,\nI\'ve come to where cliffs cleave the heaven.\nTowards a forest I turned my face\nAnd saw rich, splendid rocks that seem\nBrighter than eyes on earth have seen -\nThe gleaming glory of every glint.\nNo garment made has ever been\nOf half so dear adornment.\n\nThe valley\'s vista was adorned\nWith crystal cliffs so clear in hue\nAnd bright woods by the hills had grown\nWith trunks as blue as Indian blue.\nAnd burnished silver leaves all grind\nAnd quiver together on every bough.\nWhen gleams through glades upon them shine\nSuch shimmering shafts of sheer light show.\nThe gravel that grated on the ground\nWas precious pearls of orient.\nThe sun itself is dark and blind\nIn respect of that adornment.\n\nThe adornment of that valley dear\nCompelled my ghost to let its grief,\nFreshest scents of fruit were there \u2013\nAs if from food I was replete.\nFowls flying in the woods together\nWere flaming hues, both small and great,\nBut citole-string or citherner\nTheir music\'s mirth could not repeat,\nFor when those birds their wings beat\nThey sang with such a sweet ascent,\nSuch gracious glee no man could meet\nAs here, or see their adornment.\n\nAll was adorned in dear device\nIn the forest where fortune made me fare\nBut to describe its gloriousness\nNo human tongue deserves to dare.\nAs a walked on in greater grace\nNo course or incline caused me care.\nThe further I went the fairer rose\nThe plain, the plants - the spices, the pears -\nHedges and meadows by river.\nGorgeous with gold the steep banks bent.\nI went to the shore of the shining water -\nLord! It had a dear adornment.\n\nThe adornment of that darling deep\nWas bonny banks of beryl bright.\nSwinging sweetly the waters sweep,\nWith murmuring rondels, rippling straight.\nBright stones stood in the water\'s depth\nGlinting through glass with glimmering light\nThat streams from stars while strivers sleep,\nsparks in the sky on winter nights.\nEach pebble in the pool was set\nAn emerald, sapphire or brilliant, \nSo all the lake was set alight\nWith that dear adornment.';

			<p>Pearl, pleasant to princes' pay,<br />
and cleanly clasped in gold so clear,<br />
Out of the orient; I say<br />
I never proved her precious peer.<br />
So round, so rich in each array,<br />
So small, so smooth her sides were.<br />
Wherever I judged that gems were gay<br />
I set her single and singular.<br />
Alas! I lost it in an arbour,<br />
Through the grass to ground it got.<br />
And I pine, dying of love-danger<br />
For that precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>Since in that spot it from me sprang<br />
Often I waited, wishing for Pearl,<br />
That once was what could heal my wrong<br />
And heighten my health and make me whole.<br />
That watch just weights my heart. I wrung<br />
and drenched my breast with dearth and dole.<br />
But I never heard as sweet a song<br />
As I thought on that still hour stole.<br />
And others came into that dell<br />
To sing of sweetness clad in clot.<br />
O earth, you mar a merry jewel,<br />
My precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>That spot where spices seed and spread,<br />
There such richness to rot is run.<br />
Blooms are bright, of blue and red,<br />
That shine so sheer against the sun.<br />
There the flowers and fruit don't fade<br />
And there it drowned in dust and dung,<br />
For all grass grows from the grains of the dead<br />
Or else no wheat is brought to barn,<br />
And every good from good begun -<br />
So seemly a seed brings forth no blot.<br />
So springing spices have upwards spun<br />
From my precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>At the spot of which I tell<br />
I entered in the garden green<br />
In August, at the festival,<br />
When corn is cut with sickles keen.<br />
On the hill where the pearl fell<br />
Shadows of shimmering flowers that shone:<br />
Gillyflower, ginger and gromwell<br />
And peonies powdered in between,<br />
So seemly to be smelled and seen,<br />
With floating fragrances. I thought<br />
That this is where my dear has gone,<br />
My precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>Before that spot I stretched my hand<br />
For a cold care that in me caught:<br />
A deeper dole in my heart dinned,<br />
Though reason reckoned in my thought,<br />
And I complained that Pearl was penned,<br />
with fierce debates in me that fought.<br />
Though I of Christ the comfort kenned<br />
My wretched will in woe was wrought,<br />
I fell onto that flowery ground.<br />
Such odours to my senses shot<br />
That I slipped into sleeping sound<br />
Above my pearl without a spot.</p>
