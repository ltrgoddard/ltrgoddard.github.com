            <h2>Journalism</h2>
            <p>At <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Sunday Times</i> I work on data-driven investigations, with a particular interest in cyber-crime and the dark net. My work has included front-page expos√©s of <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/russian-hackers-trade-british-ministers-email-addresses-and-passwords-hqtr7pv9z">the black market in stolen credentials</a>, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/child-abuse-network-had-10-000-uk-members-d665p2nwk">dark net paedophile networks</a> and <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/girl-of-15-on-sugar-daddy-site-5602zrxmf">'sugar daddy' dating sites</a>, and <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/dark-net-dealers-dragged-into-the-light-kx05bc3jd">an investigation</a> naming a government contractor selling hacking equipment on a dark net market. I was the first journalist to provide <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/hanged-man-was-dark-web-mastermind-s0dqtjc6w">independent proof</a> of the link between the death of Alexandre Cazes and the shutdown of the dark net market AlphaBay.</p>
            <p>Aside from my work on cyber-crime and other original stories, I provide support to reporters and editors working on topics ranging from the royal family to pharmaceutical companies. Most of my work is done in the R programming language.</p>
            <p>In 2012 and '13 I worked as a News Writer for <em>The Verge</em>. As a freelancer I've covered <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/freedom-of-information-costs-university-spies-only-add-to-them">Freedom of Information</a>, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/exam-board-blues-are-universities-the-answer">exam boards</a> and <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/opinion/the-ahrcs-doctoral-training-disasters/2009975.article">research funding</a> for <em>Times Higher Education</em>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/05/gcse-exams-tiering-michael-gove">GCSE marking</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/09/ofsted-complaint-school-off-inspection-teachers">appeals</a> for <em>The Guardian</em> and produced a <a href="http://www.if.org.uk/archives/5409/higher-education-a-tale-of-two-payslips">report on the postgraduate funding crisis</a> for the Intergenerational Foundation.</p>

            <h2>Academic work</h2>
            <p>My doctoral thesis was a literary-historical account of the contemporary poet J.H. Prynne's early career, concentrating on the period between 1955 and 1975. I used archival materials to look closely at Prynne's British influences. I'm also interested in the digital humanities, particularly applications of social network analysis and graph theory to literary history, and have recently published articles in <em><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0950236X.2016.1188143">Textual Practice</a></em> and the <em><a href="https://poetry.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/biip.9/">Journal of British and Irish Innovative Poetry</a></em>.
