<p>I’ll soon be starting a new job as a data advisor for the NGO <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org">Global Witness</a>.</p>
<p>I finished a PhD in contemporary poetry at the University of Sussex in 2016 then worked as a data journalist at <em>The Times</em> for two and a half years. Before that I worked as a technology journalist and completed my undergraduate and masters degrees at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>At <em>The Times</em> I worked on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Athetimes.co.uk+louis+goddard">more than a dozen</a> front-page stories, including flagship investigations into <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-hackers-trade-british-ministers-email-addresses-and-passwords-hqtr7pv9z">cyber-crime</a>, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-third-of-british-billionaires-have-moved-to-a-tax-haven-zk6q53rtd">tax havens</a> and <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gagging-clauses-criticism-of-theresa-may-banned-in-grenfell-safety-deal-7mbdll6cj">government contracting</a>. I’ve spoken about my work on <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dark-net-dealers-dragged-into-the-light-kx05bc3jd">dark net markets</a> and <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/child-abuse-network-had-10-000-uk-members-d665p2nwk">child abuse forums</a> at conferences in Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the UK. My main tool is the R programming language.</p>
