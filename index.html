                        &lt;p&gt;Test, pleasant plansgs hjsadmsdsd,&lt;br /&gt;
and cleanly clasped in gold so clear,&lt;br /&gt;
Out of the orient; I say&lt;br /&gt;
I never  lkasdnklsd lkjsad ksdprecious peer.&lt;br /&gt;
So round, so rich in each array,&lt;br /&gt;
So small, so smooth her sides were.&lt;br /&gt;
Wherever I judged that gems were gay&lt;br /&gt;
I set her single and singular.&lt;br /&gt;
Alas! I ls sdsk sdskjsd in an arbour,&lt;br /&gt;
Through the grass to ground it got.&lt;br /&gt;
And I pine, dying of love-danger&lt;br /&gt;
For that precious pearl without a spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since in that spot it from me sprang&lt;br /&gt;
Often I waited, wishing for Pearl,&lt;br /&gt;
That once was what could heal my wrong&lt;br /&gt;
And heighten my health and make me whole.&lt;br /&gt;
That watch just weights my heart. I wrung&lt;br /&gt;
and drenched my breast with dearth and dole.&lt;br /&gt;
But I never heard as sweet a song&lt;br /&gt;
As I thought on that still hour stole.&lt;br /&gt;
And others came into that dell&lt;br /&gt;
To sing of asds skjlkjasd ss clad in clot.&lt;br /&gt;
O earth, you mar a merry jewel,&lt;br /&gt;
My precious pearl without a spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That spot where spices seed and spread,&lt;br /&gt;
There such richness to rot is run.&lt;br /&gt;
Blooms are bright, of blue and red,&lt;br /&gt;
That shine so sheer against the sun.&lt;br /&gt;
There the flowers and fruit don't fade&lt;br /&gt;
And there it drowned in dust and dung,&lt;br /&gt;
For all grass grows from the grains of the dead&lt;br /&gt;
Or else asdjh kjhsad lkjbrought to barn,&lt;br /&gt;
And every good from good begun -&lt;br /&gt;
So seemly a seed brings forth no blot.&lt;br /&gt;
So springing spices have upwards spun&lt;br /&gt;
From my precious pearl without a spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the spot of which I tell&lt;br /&gt;
I entered in the garden green&lt;br /&gt;
In August, at the festival,&lt;br /&gt;
When corn is cut with sickles keen.&lt;br /&gt;
On the hill where the pearl fell&lt;br /&gt;
Shadows of shimmering flowers that shone:&lt;br /&gt;
Gillyflower, ginger and gromwell&lt;br /&gt;
And peonies powdered in between,&lt;br /&gt;
So seemly to be smelled and seen,&lt;br /&gt;
With floating fragrances. I thought&lt;br /&gt;
That this is where my dear has gone,&lt;br /&gt;
My precious pearl without a spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that spot I stretched my hand&lt;br /&gt;
For a cold care that in me caught:&lt;br /&gt;
A deeper dole in my heart dinned,&lt;br /&gt;
Though reason reckoned in my thought,&lt;br /&gt;
And I complained that Pearl was penned,&lt;br /&gt;
with fierce debates in me that fought.&lt;br /&gt;
Though I of Christ the comfort kenned&lt;br /&gt;
My wretched will in woe was wrought,&lt;br /&gt;
I fell onto that flowery ground.&lt;br /&gt;
Such odours to my senses shot&lt;br /&gt;
That I slipped into sleeping sound&lt;br /&gt;
Above my pearl without a spot.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;';
