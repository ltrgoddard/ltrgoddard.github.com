			<h2 class="numeral">I</h2>
			<p>Pearl, pleasant to princes' pay,<br />
and cleanly clasped in gold so clear,<br />
Out of the orient; I say<br />
I never proved her precious peer.<br />
So round, so rich in each array,<br />
So small, so smooth her sides were.<br />
Wherever I judged that gems were gay<br />
I set her single and singular.<br />
Alas! I lost it in an arbour,<br />
Through the grass to ground it got.<br />
And I pine, dying of love-danger<br />
For that precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>Since in that spot it from me sprang<br />
Often I waited, wishing for Pearl,<br />
That once was what could heal my wrong<br />
And heighten my health and make me whole.<br />
That watch just weights my heart. I wrung<br />
and drenched my breast with dearth and dole.<br />
But I never heard as sweet a song<br />
As I thought on that still hour stole.<br />
And others came into that dell<br />
To sing of sweetness clad in clot.<br />
O earth, you mar a merry jewel,<br />
My precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>That spot where spices seed and spread,<br />
There such richness to rot is run.<br />
Blooms are bright, of blue and red,<br />
That shine so sheer against the sun.<br />
There the flowers and fruit don't fade<br />
And there it drowned in dust and dung,<br />
For all grass grows from the grains of the dead<br />
Or else no wheat is brought to barn,<br />
And every good from good begun -<br />
So seemly a seed brings forth no blot.<br />
So springing spices have upwards spun<br />
From my precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>At the spot of which I tell<br />
I entered in the garden green<br />
In August, at the festival,<br />
When corn is cut with sickles keen.<br />
On the hill where the pearl fell<br />
Shadows of shimmering flowers that shone:<br />
Gillyflower, ginger and gromwell<br />
And peonies powdered in between,<br />
So seemly to be smelled and seen,<br />
With floating fragrances. I thought<br />
That this is where my dear has gone,<br />
My precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>Before that spot I stretched my hand<br />
For a cold care that in me caught:<br />
A deeper dole in my heart dinned,<br />
Though reason reckoned in my thought,<br />
And I complained that Pearl was penned,<br />
with fierce debates in me that fought.<br />
Though I of Christ the comfort kenned<br />
My wretched will in woe was wrought,<br />
I fell onto that flowery ground.<br />
Such odours to my senses shot<br />
That I slipped into sleeping sound<br />
Above my pearl without a spot.</p>
