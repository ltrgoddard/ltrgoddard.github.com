            <h2>Journalism</h2>
            <p>At <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Sunday Times</i> I work on data-driven investigations and cover current events from a computational perspective. Recent projects have included a <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/us-election/number-crunching-how-the-pollsters-got-it-wrong-d6t2rj2c7">snap analysis</a> of the 2016 US election results, a <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/crackdown-on-rip-off-charges-for-electric-cars-jvsz0vkw2">front-page story</a> on the cost of charging electric cars and an <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/ambulance-trusts-use-loophole-to-claim-faster-response-times-9mt7hgbp5">investigation</a> of ambulance response times using tens of millions of 999 calls. I work primarily in R, Python and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In 2012 and '13 I worked as a News Writer for <em>The Verge</em>. In recent years as a freelancer I've covered <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/freedom-of-information-costs-university-spies-only-add-to-them">Freedom of Information</a>, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/exam-board-blues-are-universities-the-answer">exam boards</a> and <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/opinion/the-ahrcs-doctoral-training-disasters/2009975.article">research funding</a> for <em>Times Higher Education</em>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/05/gcse-exams-tiering-michael-gove">GCSE marking</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/09/ofsted-complaint-school-off-inspection-teachers">appeals</a> for <em>The Guardian</em> and produced a <a href="http://www.if.org.uk/archives/5409/higher-education-a-tale-of-two-payslips">report on the postgraduate funding crisis</a> for the Intergenerational Foundation.</p>

            <h2>Academic work</h2>
            <p>My thesis is a literary-historical account of the contemporary poet J.H. Prynne's early career, concentrating on the period between 1955 and 1975. I use archival materials to look closely at Prynne's British influences. I'm also interested in the digital humanities, particularly applications of social network analysis and graph theory to literary history. For more information, see my <a href="cv.html">academic CV</a> and my <a href="http://github.com/ltrgoddard">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
