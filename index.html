			<p>Pearl, pleasant to princes' pay,
and cleanly clasped in gold so clear,
Out of the orient; I say
I never proved her precious peer.
So round, so rich in each array,
So small, so smooth her sides were.
Wherever I judged that gems were gay
I set her single and singular.
Alas! I lost it in an arbour,
Through the grass to ground it got.
And I pine, dying of love-danger
For that precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>Since in that spot it from me sprang
Often I waited, wishing for Pearl,
That once was what could heal my wrong
And heighten my health and make me whole.
That watch just weights my heart. I wrung
and drenched my breast with dearth and dole.
But I never heard as sweet a song
As I thought on that still hour stole.
And others came into that dell
To sing of sweetness clad in clot.
O earth, you mar a merry jewel,
My precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>That spot where spices seed and spread,
There such richness to rot is run.
Blooms are bright, of blue and red,
That shine so sheer against the sun.
There the flowers and fruit don't fade
And there it drowned in dust and dung,
For all grass grows from the grains of the dead
Or else no wheat is brought to barn,
And every good from good begun -
So seemly a seed brings forth no blot.
So springing spices have upwards spun
From my precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>At the spot of which I tell
I entered in the garden green
In August, at the festival,
When corn is cut with sickles keen.
On the hill where the pearl fell
Shadows of shimmering flowers that shone:
Gillyflower, ginger and gromwell
And peonies powdered in between,
So seemly to be smelled and seen,
With floating fragrances. I thought
That this is where my dear has gone,
My precious pearl without a spot.</p>

<p>Before that spot I stretched my hand
For a cold care that in me caught:
A deeper dole in my heart dinned,
Though reason reckoned in my thought,
And I complained that Pearl was penned,
with fierce debates in me that fought.
Though I of Christ the comfort kenned
My wretched will in woe was wrought,
I fell onto that flowery ground.
Such odours to my senses shot
That I slipped into sleeping sound
Above my pearl without a spot.</p>
